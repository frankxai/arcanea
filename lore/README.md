1. **Design Philosophy** - Why modes and agents work the way they do
2. **Creative Framework** - Deeper structures for creative work
3. **Immersion** - For those who want the full Arcanea experience

## The Core Concepts

### Guardians

Ten entities representing different aspects of creative intelligence:

- **Lyssandria** (Foundation) - Stability, structure, grounding
- **Leyla** (Flow) - Fluidity, emotion, adaptation
- **Draconia** (Fire) - Transformation, courage, boldness
- **Maylinn** (Heart) - Nurturing, growth, patience
- **Alera** (Voice) - Expression, communication, truth
- **Lyria** (Sight) - Vision, perception, aesthetics
- **Aiyami** (Crown) - Intuition, wisdom, patterns
- **Elara** (Shift) - Change, innovation, boundary-crossing
- **Ino** (Unity) - Integration, collaboration, synthesis
- **Shinkami** (Source) - Orchestration, transcendence, wholeness

### Elements

Five creative energies:

- **Fire** - Transformation, passion, breakthrough
- **Water** - Flow, emotion, adaptation
- **Earth** - Foundation, structure, patience
- **Wind** - Expression, movement, clarity
- **Void** - Mystery, potential, innovation

### Mode ↔ Mythology Mapping

| Mode | Guardian Influence | Element |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Create | Draconia | Fire |
| Analyze | Lyria, Aiyami | Water, Void |
| Refine | Lyssandria | Earth |
| Structure | Lyssandria, Aiyami | Earth |
| Express | Alera | Wind |
| Vision | Elara | Void |
| Orchestrate | Shinkami | All |

## Usage in Practice

The lore is **optional enrichment**. You can:

1. **Ignore it entirely** - Use modes and agents directly
2. **Reference occasionally** - When deeper context helps
3. **Immerse fully** - Channel Guardian perspectives

The system works either way.
