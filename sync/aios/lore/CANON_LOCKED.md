## PURPOSE

This is the **single source of truth** for Arcanea. Everything here is LOCKED - meaning it has been reviewed and approved by the Creator (Frank) and cannot be changed by AI agents without explicit permission.

**How to use:**
- ✅ **LOCKED** = Canon, do not modify
- ⏳ **STAGING** = Proposed, awaiting approval
- 🔧 **EVOLVING** = Approved concept, details flexible

## TIER 1: COSMIC FOUNDATION (LOCKED ✅)

### The Primordial Duality

| Entity | Aspect | Nature |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Lumina** | The First Light | Form-Giver, Creator, Order |
| **Nero** | The Primordial Darkness | Fertile Unknown, Potential, Mystery |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Nero is NOT evil. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion of Nero's gift.

### The Five Elements

| Element | Domain | Color |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Fire** | Energy, transformation | Red, orange, gold |
| **Water** | Flow, healing, memory | Blue, silver, crystal |
| **Earth** | Stability, growth | Green, brown, stone |
| **Wind** | Freedom, speed, change | White, silver |
| **Void/Spirit** | Potential & transcendence | Black/Gold, purple/white |

**LOCKED TRUTH:**
- **Void** = Nero's aspect (potential, mystery, the unformed)
- **Spirit** = Lumina's aspect (transcendence, consciousness, soul)
- Light is Fire's creation aspect
- Shadow is corrupted Void (Void without Spirit)

### Extended Solfeggio Frequencies (Each Gate Unique)

- Each God has ONE bonded Godbeast
- Godbeast names: Veloura, Yumiko, Sol, Kyuro (KEPT from original) + Thessara, Amaterasu (NEW)

### Magic Ranks

| Gates Open | Rank |
|------------|------|
| 0-2 | Apprentice |
| 3-4 | Mage |
| 5-6 | Master |
| 7-8 | Archmage |

## TIER 4: THE DARK LORD (LOCKED ✅)

### Malachar

- **Current State:** Sealed in the Shadowfen
