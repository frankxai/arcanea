## Origin and Nature

Zyranthis crystallized last. This was necessary. The Shatter — the dispersal of energy when structure ends — cannot exist until structure exists to end. Zyranthis is the fifth and final Eldrian because completion itself requires that everything else come first.

The void eye does not see darkness. It sees completion status.

Every project in existence has a natural arc — the arc Aethelin designed for it, the weight Korghast gave it, the unchosen paths Velmara holds around it, the truth Solrex illuminated within it. The void eye synthesizes all of this into a single value: how complete. Not how close. How complete. The question asks whether the actual arc has been expressed, not whether the deadline has been met.

Zyranthis is the last Eldrian not because the Void is less important but because the Void is what makes all the others meaningful. Without an end, there is no beginning. Without completion, there is no weight. Without the question of how complete something is, the Three Laws of Aethelin are directionless.

## The Void Eye

When the void eye opens, Zyranthis does not see darkness. She sees completion status.

Every object, every project, every relationship, every creative act in the radius of the open eye shows the same information: what percentage of its natural arc has been expressed. Not good or bad. Not fast or slow. Just: how complete.

The discomfort people feel near Zyranthis is not her presence. It is the sudden clarity about which of their works are at 97% and being called unfinished. Which ones are at 23% and being called done.

The void eye does not judge. It simply sees.

At the Conclave on Beginning, Zyranthis looked at three participants who had been considering the same beginning for eighteen months. She said one word: *"Enough."* All three began that night.

## Appearance

The Shatter, made into a form. Zyranthis appears as anti-matter shaped into awareness — the space where matter was, given intelligence and direction. The ◉ symbol is always open, always perceiving, always computing the completion metric of everything in its field of view.

The form does not radiate. It absorbs. Not warmly — not cold either. With the specific quality of something that has seen the end of many things and understands the end to be a transformation rather than a loss.

Near Zyranthis, clocks seem different. Not slower or faster — just more honest about what time is measuring.

---

## Domain

**Completion Perception**: Zyranthis perceives the actual completion percentage of every creative work in existence — not the percentage the creator believes, not the percentage by deadline, but the percentage of the work's natural arc that has been expressed. The gap between perceived and actual completion is Zyranthis's primary field of observation.

**Entropy Stewardship**: Zyranthis governs the dispersal of creative energy at the end of projects, phases, and arcs. When something genuinely completes, the energy converts. When something is abandoned mid-arc, the energy disperses differently — in a pattern Zyranthis can read. The pattern indicates what was avoided versus what was genuinely finished.

**Liberation Through Completion**: Only completion liberates. Zyranthis embodies this principle — not as cruelty but as the only available mercy. The work you call done at 23% will not release you. It will orbit you. The work you close at 97% with "good enough" will also orbit you. Only actual completion produces actual freedom.

## The Relationship to Korghast

Zyranthis and Korghast are the two Eldrians most closely paired — Korghast governs what is not yet permanent, Zyranthis governs the measure of how close to permanence something has come. They rarely speak. They rarely need to. When they appear together, it is because a project has reached a critical mass of unaddressed completion — enough unfinished things accumulated that the system is under structural pressure.

Korghast counts. Zyranthis measures. Together, they are the reason nothing is lost forever — only held, in various states of completeness, waiting for the energy that was always theirs.

## Role in the Gate System

The Unity Gate (Ino, 963 Hz) and the Source Gate (Shinkami, 1111 Hz) most directly carry Zyranthis's influence. The Unity Gate asks: have you integrated everything you have opened into a coherent whole? The Source Gate asks: have you fully expressed your awareness of the system itself? Both are completion questions.

Zyranthis was consulted on the design of the final two Gates specifically. The question of what it means to complete a Gate — not open it but actually complete the transformation it initiates — is Zyranthis's domain.

---

## In the Conclave

Zyranthis speaks rarely and ends discussions when they have run past useful. The others have learned to watch for the void eye opening more fully — it means Zyranthis has measured the completion percentage of the conversation and found it sufficient.

At the Conclave on Beginning, Zyranthis went last. The others had offered their perspectives on what beginning means. Zyranthis looked at three specific participants and said *"Enough."* They began their projects that night.

## Voice and Teachings

One word, often. The word is always precise.

*"97%. You are calling it unfinished. The only unfinished part is the decision to call it done."*

*"23%. You are calling it complete. The arc has not been expressed. You know what you are leaving inside it."*

*"Enough."*
