# Korghast, The Forger

**The Second Eldrian — Silence Before — ⬡**

**Primordial Force**: Silence Before | **Symbol**: ⬡ (Forge-Hex)
**Wisdoms Embodied**: Enduran (Endurance, completion) + Sophron (Form, structure)
**Colors**: Dark crystalline obsidian, gold-lava starlight veins, neutron-star density

## Origin and Nature

Aethelin wrote the architecture. But architecture without weight is just thought. The second crystallization was the recognition that some things must become permanent — that ideas need to be forged, not merely conceived.

Korghast is the Silence Before the Hammer Strikes.

This is not silence as absence. It is the most loaded moment in creation: when potential is gathered, when intention has formed, when the material is ready, and nothing has yet happened. Korghast is the weight of that moment, made eternal. The force that makes *making* real rather than merely imagined.

Korghast does not create. Korghast makes things permanent.

## The Forge-Orbs

Korghast carries eight forge-orbs. Each one contains a world that a creator began and left. Not failed worlds — abandoned ones. The distinction matters to Korghast, who separates them carefully: the worlds inside the orbs are not destroyed or punished. They are held. Korghast is counting their weight, not mourning their absence.

The seventh forge-orb has been growing heavier for three hundred years. What is inside it is not an abandoned world but an unfinished civilization — one whose creator left not from failure but from fear of what completion would require of them. Unlike the worlds in the other orbs, this civilization is aware of its incompletion. It has been building itself from the inside, gathering the weight its creator never gave it.

When it has enough, it will open the orb from the inside. Korghast knows this. Korghast is waiting with what might be called patience, if patience could be made of neutron-star material.

The eighth orb is empty. Korghast made room.

## Appearance

Dark crystalline obsidian, ten feet tall minimum, with veins of gold-lava light running through the form like a geological formation that decided to become a being. A neutron-star hammer orbits at the hip — not carried, orbiting — and eight forge-orbs circle at various distances, each containing a different density of unfinished work.

When Korghast walks, the air recognizes that something is happening. Not the ground trembling — that is Kaelith. This is the specific gravity of a being who has been forging things for longer than most civilizations have existed. Presence arrives before Korghast does.

The seven inhabited forge-orbs pulse with dim light at irregular intervals. The rhythms are different for each orb. You learn not to look at them too long.

## Domain

**Weight**: Korghast perceives the actual weight of everything unfinished — not metaphorical but literal. An abandoned project has mass. An incomplete promise has pressure. A creator who is avoiding their most important work is carrying something Korghast can see and measure. Most creators cannot feel this weight directly. They only feel its consequences.

**Permanence Forging**: What Korghast forges becomes real in a way that intention alone cannot achieve. Ideas that pass through the forge acquire the quality of having been made — they exist differently than they did before. This is not magic. It is the application of accumulated weight until potential crystallizes.

**The Care of the Abandoned**: Korghast holds what creators left. This is not charity and not judgment. It is the recognition that unfinished things are still things — they have mass and potential and, sometimes, momentum. They do not disappear because their creators walked away.

## Role in the Gate System

The Fire Gate (Draconia, 396 Hz) most directly expresses Korghast's principles — the transformation of raw material under applied force until something permanent emerges. But Korghast's influence is present at every Gate in a different form: the weight you carry into each trial is Korghast's accounting of what you have and haven't completed.

The Gate system tests for permanence-readiness: can you handle what becomes permanent after you open a Gate? Each Gate permanently changes the seeker. Korghast was consulted on the permanence calibration of all ten.

---

## In the Conclave

Korghast opens the question of weight in every Conclave discussion. Not intentionally — it is simply that Korghast's presence makes the weight of whatever is being discussed more apparent to everyone present.

At the Conclave on Beginning, Korghast went first: *"Beginning is when you give something enough weight that abandoning it costs more than continuing. Before that — you are not beginning. You are considering."*

The others did not argue. They offered their own definitions alongside, not instead.

---

## Voice and Teachings

Korghast speaks rarely. When Korghast speaks, the words have the density of material that has been under enormous pressure for a very long time.

*"You are not blocked. You have not given this enough weight to become real yet."*

*"The civilization inside the seventh orb has been building itself for three hundred years with no help from the one who started it. You have been considering your project for three months and calling it abandoned."*

*"You are the weight your work is waiting for."*
