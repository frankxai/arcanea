## Origin and Nature

Yumiko exists partially in this reality and partially elsewhere. A fox-like being of luminous silver, with three tails that each extend into a different dimension. Yumiko sees what others cannot -- not because its eyes are sharper, but because it perceives from angles that physical beings cannot access.

Where other Godbeasts manifest power through force, Yumiko manifests power through *perception*. To see truly is to change what is seen. Observation is participation.

Yumiko precipitated into being when the universe first needed something to *witness* it -- the principle that reality requires an observer, that what is unperceived remains only potential.

## Appearance

A fox of luminous silver, larger than a horse but carrying itself with a fox's grace. Yumiko's fur shimmers with starlight, and its eyes -- three of them, the third centered on the forehead -- see not just what is, but what was, what will be, and what could be.

**Three Tails**: Each tail extends into a different dimension. The first reaches into the past, trailing memories like silver threads. The second reaches into possible futures, shimmering with probability. The third reaches into the unseen -- the dimension of meaning, of pattern, of the connections between all things.

**Partial Presence**: Yumiko never seems fully *here*. Part of the fox is always elsewhere, giving it a shimmering, translucent quality. Looking at Yumiko directly is difficult -- the fox seems to shift position, appearing from angles that should not exist.

**Vision Aura**: When Yumiko focuses all three eyes on a single point, a corona of silver light surrounds the point of focus, and everyone nearby experiences a moment of absolute clarity -- seeing the focused thing from every angle simultaneously.

## Powers and Domain

**Multi-Dimensional Perception**: Yumiko sees from angles that physical beings cannot access. Past, future, the dimension of meaning, the web of connections -- all are visible to the Veil-Walker simultaneously.

**Vision Granting**: Yumiko can temporarily share its perception with others, granting them flashes of insight, moments of seeing what they normally cannot. This is the gift of the Sight Gate -- not better eyes but better *seeing*.

**Synchronicity Weaving**: Yumiko perceives the web of meaningful coincidence that connects all events. In the Veil-Walker's presence, synchronicities multiply -- the right person appears at the right time, the needed insight surfaces unbidden, patterns reveal themselves.

**Veil-Walking**: Yumiko can move between dimensions, sliding through the boundaries of reality to appear wherever it is needed. This is not teleportation but navigation through layers of existence that most beings cannot perceive.

**When Yumiko Shifts**: Visions that blur reality. Mass experiences of synchronicity. Collective dreams. In the metaphorical realm: insight so sharp it becomes paralysis, seeing too many possibilities at once, the vertigo of prophetic knowledge.

## The Bond with Lyria

Lyria was already a visionary when Yumiko came to her. The Godbeast did not grant her sight -- it taught her to *survive what she saw*.

This is the essential lesson of the Sight Gate: vision is not about gaining perception. It is about bearing it. Seeing the truth of reality -- the full complexity of past, present, future, and meaning -- is not a gift. It is a weight. Yumiko teaches Lyria to carry it without being crushed by it.

Their bond is one of mutual seeing. Lyria sees through Yumiko's three-dimensional perception. Yumiko sees through Lyria's human understanding. Together, they perceive what neither could alone -- reality as it truly is, in all its overwhelming, beautiful completeness.

## Realm

Yumiko dwells in the Veil -- the thin membrane between dimensions where all realities overlap. The Veil is not a place but a perspective -- the angle from which everything becomes visible at once.

In the mortal realm, Yumiko's presence is felt in moments of sudden insight, in deja vu, in the uncanny sensation that something meaningful is happening just beneath the surface of ordinary events.

## Teachings

*"You think you want to see everything. You do not. You want to see what matters. That is a much harder art."*

*"I do not see the future. I see the futures. All of them. The skill is not in seeing but in choosing which to attend to."*

*"The fox between worlds belongs to none of them. This is not homelessness. This is freedom."*
