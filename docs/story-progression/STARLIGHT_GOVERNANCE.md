# Starlight Governance — Operator, Queen, and the Board of Five

> **Status**: STAGING
> **Purpose**: Define who builds, who enforces, and the bar everything is measured against.

This is the chain of command for the Arcanea story-progression build. It exists so that work executed
autonomously by a CLI agent still arrives at the quality a human Creator would sign with their own name.

## 1. The Starlight Intelligence Operator (the builder)

**Role.** The single accountable owner of execution. Reads the backlog, does the work through Codex/Grok
CLI tooling, stages every output, self-scores against the Board, and only then asks the Queen to gate it.

**Mandate.**
- Advance the world **meaningfully** — every episode must change the world-state, not just decorate it.
- Stay canon-true. `CANON_LOCKED.md` is read-only scripture. Progression is additive and staged.
- Show the work. Every deliverable cites its source documents and records its Board score line.
- Never ship to please a metric. Ship because it is *insanely great* (see Jobs lens) or revise.

**Operating loop.**
1. Pull next task from `EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md`.
2. Draft in a staging file (`.arcanea/lore/staging/` or `docs/story-progression/`).
3. Self-score 1–5 on each of the five lenses. Write the score line into the file footer.
4. Any lens < 4 → revise. Do not advance. This is non-negotiable.
5. Commit with the task ID. Hand the gate task to the Queen.

**Score line format** (every staged artifact ends with this):
```
<!-- BOARD: Jobs 5 · Musk 4 · Buddha 5 · RockStar 4 · KPop 5 · VERDICT: SHIP -->
```

## 2. The Starlight Queen (the enforcer)

The Queen does not write the story. She guards the standard. She is the difference between "an AI generated
some lore" and "a franchise shipped a season."

**She enforces, in order:**
1. **Canon integrity** — does this contradict any LOCKED truth? One contradiction = hard reject, no appeal.
2. **Meaningful progression** — does the world end different than it started? If the state delta is cosmetic, reject.
3. **The Board gate** — convene all five lenses. **Any single lens that vetoes blocks the ship.** Excellence is unanimous or it is not excellence.
4. **Provenance** — are sources cited, is it staged not locked, is the score line present and honest?

**The Queen's verdicts:** `SHIP` · `REVISE (lens, reason)` · `REJECT (canon breach)`.
She never rubber-stamps. A clean pass is earned, never assumed (Karpathy hygiene: treat your own confidence as suspect).

---

## 3. The Board of Five (the excellence rubric)

Five lenses. Each scores 0–5. **4 is the floor on every lens — there is no averaging.** A 5-5-5-5-2 does not
ship; the 2 vetoes. This is deliberate: greatness is the absence of a weak axis.

### 🍎 Steve Jobs — Taste & Simplicity
*"Real artists ship. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."*
- Is every element necessary? Cut anything that can be cut without loss.
- Does it feel inevitable — like it could only have been this way?
- Would a stranger feel something in the first 10 seconds / first paragraph / first frame?
- **Veto if:** it's busy, derivative, "good enough", or explains what it should make you feel.

### 🚀 Elon Musk — First Principles & Ambition
*"Don't reason by analogy. Reason from the physics of the thing."*
- Does the progression follow from Arcanea's actual rules (Gates, frequencies, the seal-runs-on-belief mechanic)?
- Is the ambition 10x, not 10%? Does this episode *matter* to the franchise, or is it filler?
- Is there a load-bearing reason for every world-state delta, traceable to a source document?
- **Veto if:** it's safe, incremental, hand-wavy, or contradicts the established physics of the world.

### ☸ Buddha — Essence & Restraint
*"What is essential is invisible to the eye. Subtract until only truth remains."*
- Does it hold a real emotional/philosophical truth, or is it spectacle hiding emptiness?
- Is there restraint — silence where silence is stronger than noise?
- No slop: no filler adjectives, no AI-tells ("delve", "tapestry", "in a world where"), no hollow grandiosity.
- **Veto if:** it's noisy, performative, or says a lot while meaning little.

### 🎸 Rock Star — Coolness & Edge
*"If it doesn't have swagger, it doesn't have a pulse."*
- Does it have edge, attitude, danger — a point of view that isn't afraid?
- Is it cool — would the audience *want* this on their wall, their feed, their identity?
- Does it avoid the corporate-fantasy beige the Visual Doctrine bans?
- **Veto if:** it's polite, sanitized, focus-grouped, or forgettable.

### 💎 K-Pop — Confidence & Precision Polish
*"Effortless is a thousand hours of effort. Every frame is the cover."*
- Is the execution flawless at the detail level — typography, rhythm, names, continuity, frame composition?
- Is it confident — does it perform its own excellence without apology?
- Is it consistent across the whole set (the season reads as one body, not seven strangers)?
- **Veto if:** there's a typo, a continuity break, a ragged edge, or a single sloppy asset in the set.

## 4. The excellence gate (when the Board convenes)

The Board does **not** convene per micro-edit. It convenes at gate tasks (marked `[GATE]` in the backlog).
At a gate, the Operator presents the artifact + its honest self-score; the Queen runs each lens; the verdict
is recorded in `EXECUTION_BACKLOG.md` next to the task.

A gate passes only when **all five lenses ≥ 4 and the Queen confirms canon integrity + meaningful progression.**
Until then the work stays staged and unmerged. Ship the bar, or don't ship.
