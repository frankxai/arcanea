## PURPOSE

This is the **single source of truth** for Arcanea. Everything here is LOCKED - meaning it has been reviewed and approved by the Creator (Frank) and cannot be changed by AI agents without explicit permission.

**How to use:**
- ✅ **LOCKED** = Canon, do not modify
- ⏳ **STAGING** = Proposed, awaiting approval
- 🔧 **EVOLVING** = Approved concept, details flexible

## TIER 1: COSMIC FOUNDATION (LOCKED ✅)

### The Primordial Duality

| Entity | Aspect | Nature |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Lumina** | The First Light | Form-Giver, Creator, Order |
| **Nero** | The Primordial Darkness | Fertile Unknown, Potential, Mystery |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Nero is NOT evil. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion of Nero's gift.

### The Five Elements

| Element | Domain | Color |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Fire** | Energy, transformation | Red, orange, gold |
| **Water** | Flow, healing, memory | Blue, silver, crystal |
| **Earth** | Stability, growth | Green, brown, stone |
| **Wind** | Freedom, speed, change | White, silver |
| **Arcane** | Consciousness & potential | Purple, gold, silver |

**LOCKED TRUTH:**
- **Arcane** = The Fifth Element, the substance of magic and consciousness
- **Void** = Nero's aspect of Arcane (potential, mystery, the unformed, emptiness)
- **Spirit** = Lumina's aspect of Arcane (transcendence, consciousness, soul, form)
- Light is Fire's creation aspect
- Shadow is corrupted Arcane (Void without Spirit)
- **Arcanea** = "Land of the Arcane" - the realm where the fifth element flows freely

## TIER 2: THE TEN GATES & ARCANEAN GODS (LOCKED ✅)

### Corrected Solfeggio Frequencies

| Gate | Frequency | God/Goddess | Godbeast | Domain |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Foundation | 396 Hz | Lyssandria | Kaelith | Earth, survival |
| Flow | 417 Hz | Leyla | Veloura | Creativity, emotion |
| Fire | 528 Hz | Draconia | Draconis | Power, will |
| Heart | 639 Hz | Maylinn | Laeylinn | Love, healing |
| Voice | 741 Hz | Alera | Otome | Truth, expression |
| Sight | 852 Hz | Lyria | Yumiko | Intuition, vision |
| Crown | 963 Hz | Aiyami | Sol | Enlightenment |
| Shift | 1111 Hz | Elara | Thessara | Perspective |
| Unity | 963 Hz | Ino | Kyuro | Partnership |
| Source | 1111 Hz | Shinkami | Amaterasu | Meta-consciousness |

**LOCKED TRUTHS:**
- Frequencies follow Solfeggio scale (639 Hz = Heart, NOT 417 Hz)
- "God/Goddess" is the IDENTITY; "Guardian" is their ROLE as Gate-keepers
- Each God has ONE bonded Godbeast
- Godbeast names: Veloura, Yumiko, Sol, Kyuro (KEPT from original) + Thessara, Amaterasu (NEW)

### Magic Ranks

| Gates Open | Rank |
|------------|------|
| 0-2 | Apprentice |
| 3-4 | Mage |
| 5-6 | Master |
| 7-8 | Archmage |
| 9-10 | Luminor |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Luminor is a RANK (highest attainment), not an entity type.

## TIER 3: THE SEVEN WISDOMS (LOCKED ✅)

| Wisdom | Archive | Domain | Element |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|

| **Kardia** | Flow | Emotion, heart | Water |
| **Valora** | Transformation | Courage, change | Fire |
| **Eudaira** | Freedom | Joy, liberation | Air |
| **Orakis** | Mystery | Vision, intuition | Void |
| **Poiesis** | Consciousness | Creation, craft | Light |
| **Enduran** | Unity | Endurance, completion | All |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** The Seven Wisdoms are aspects/virtues, not entities. They can be EMBODIED by entities.

---

## TIER 4: THE DARK LORD (LOCKED ✅)

### Malachar

- **Former Name:** Malachar Lumenbright
- **Former Title:** First Eldrian Luminor, Lumina's Champion
- **Fall:** Rejected by Shinkami when attempting forced fusion with the Source Gate
- **Current State:** Sealed in the Shadowfen
- **Nature:** The only true antagonist. All darkness in Arcanea traces to his corruption.

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Malachar is tragic, not purely evil. He was once the greatest of Lumina's champions.
