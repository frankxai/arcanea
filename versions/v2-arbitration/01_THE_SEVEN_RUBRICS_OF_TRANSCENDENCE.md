# The Seven Rubrics of Transcendence

## 0. The Mandate

To ensure the Arcanea V2 ecosystem achieves its highest potential, all competing proposals shall be evaluated against a universal standard. These Seven Rubrics of Transcendence serve as that standard. They are the measure of our ambition and the definition of our success. They are designed to balance the mystical with the practical, the dream with the execution. A winning proposal must not excel in one area but must harmonize all seven.

- **1 (Poor):** The proposal does not address the ecosystem's economy.

### Rubric 6: Evolutionary Potential (The Future)

This rubric measures the proposal's capacity for growth, adaptation, and self-improvement. It is the measure of the project's lifespan.

- **5 (Transcendent):** The system is designed to be anti-fragile and self-improving, with clear mechanisms for community-driven evolution and the potential to grow far beyond its original scope.
- **4 (Excellent):** The proposal has a clear vision for future growth and extensibility.
- **3 (Good):** The proposal includes a conventional roadmap for future features.
- **2 (Fair):** The proposal seems short-sighted or difficult to extend.
- **1 (Poor):** The proposal has no vision for the future.

### Rubric 7: Actionable Immediacy (The Start)

- **5 (Transcendent):** The proposal includes a working prototype or a clear, brilliant first step that immediately validates the core vision and provides a foundation to build upon.
- **4 (Excellent):** The proposal outlines a clear, practical, and compelling first phase of development.
- **3 (Good):** The proposal has a reasonable, if standard, project plan.
- **2 (Fair):** The path to begin is unclear, overly ambitious, or relies on non-existent technology.
- **1 (Poor):** The proposal is pure theory with no clear starting point.
