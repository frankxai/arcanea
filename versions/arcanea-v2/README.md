# Arcanea V2 Decision Codex

This folder records the synthesis of the three competitive blueprints (Claude v2, Gemini v2, Codex v2) into a single directive for Arcanea’s next evolution. It captures:

- Comparative evaluation across language, mythology, product architecture, and operational rigor.
- The harmonized canon, strategy, and standards every agent (Claude, Gemini, Codex, others) must now follow.
- Rubrics for excellence and iteration protocols so future revisions can be benchmarked consistently.

Reference materials:
- `../docs/Codex-v2/` – operative doctrine (ground truth).
- `../Claude v2/` – inspiration deck with mythic/agent orchestration concepts.
- `./gemini-v2/` – realm engine unification concepts.

Use this decision suite as the adjudicated source when aligning new contributions or evaluating competing proposals.
