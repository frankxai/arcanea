# ARCANEA FOUNDATION PROTOCOL
# Single Source of Truth for All Agents
# Version: 2.0 (Post-Simplification)

## CORE VISION
Arcanea is the global standard for magical creation where anyone learns to create anything through AI-powered magic.
- Platform: Social network for multiverse creators (Meta polish + Marvel storytelling)
- Product: Arcanea Studio (prompt system + generative desks + AI concierge)
- Economy: Creator-first (subscription + credits → ARC/NEA tokens later)

## MANDATORY TERMINOLOGY (All Agents Must Use)
Creator = The person using Arcanea
Guardian = Personal AI companion that learns your style
Luminor = Specialized AI assistants (music, visual, story)

Studio = Core creation platform
Portal = Interface/entry point

## FORBIDDEN TERMS (Never Use These)

## ACADEMIES STRUCTURE
Atlantean Academy = Storytelling & narrative (underwater/Atlantis theme)
Draconic Academy = Visual creation & art (sky-bound/dragon theme)
Creation & Light Academy = Music & audio (central/Soul Guardians theme)

## APL (ARCANEAN PROMPT LANGUAGE) STANDARD

All AI interactions should use or understand APL syntax
