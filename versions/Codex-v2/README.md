# Codex v2 – Arcanea Creative Intelligence Doctrine

Codex v2 is the living ops bible for every Arcanea agent, human or synthetic. It fuses the mythic canon, product architecture, design language, and execution playbooks into a single framework so every contributor can build in perfect harmony.

This folder contains:

- `01_foundational_truths.md` – the mythic strata, guiding vows, and realm map.
- `02_language_and_tone.md` – how Arcanea speaks, writes, and casts spells through words.
- `03_design_system.md` – the cinematic visual grammar for apps, rituals, and worlds.
- `04_product_architecture.md` – the ecosystem blueprint from Library to Sanctuary and beyond.
- `05_execution_playbook.md` – roadmaps, rituals, and governance rhythms.
- `06_agent_operating_manifesto.md` – rules of engagement for every coding agent and AI collaborator.

Use this canon as the source of truth when authoring strategies, designs, or code. Keep it synchronized with the Atlas and update companion datasets as the realms evolve.
