## Lyrics for the Creative Soul

> *"What cannot be said may yet be sung. The melody carries what words alone cannot."*

## Overview

These songs have been sung in Arcanea since the earliest ages. They are meant to be sung—alone or together, with melody or as rhythmic speech.

The words alone carry meaning. The singing carries them deeper.

## The Songs and the Gates

Songs resonate with frequencies. Each Gate has its frequency, and certain songs align with specific Gates:

| Song Type | Gate Alignment | Frequency |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Morning Songs | Foundation | 174 Hz |
| Work Songs | Fire | 396 Hz |
| Songs of Struggle | Heart/Shift | 417 Hz / 852 Hz |
| Songs of Celebration | Voice | 528 Hz |
| Sacred Hymns | Source | 1111 Hz |

The World Song of Yggdrasil itself vibrates at 432 Hz—the harmony of creation. All Arcanean songs are tuned to this master frequency.
