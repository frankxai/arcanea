## The Seven Regions and the Arc

The journey through territories mirrors the Arc of existence:
- **Borderlands → Plains** — Potential becomes Manifestation
- **Forest → Mountains** — Experience deepens through challenge
- **Valley** — The heart of Manifestation
- **Desert** — Dissolution, the necessary darkness
- **Highlands** — Evolved Potential, carrying wisdom forward

The special territories (Islands of Flow, Shadowlands, Threshold) are places outside the main Arc—moments of grace or crisis that interrupt the pattern.

## Guardians as Guides

Each Guardian can serve as guide through specific territories:
- **Lyssandria** guides through the Borderlands (Foundation)
- **Leyla** guides through the Plains of Learning (Flow)
- **Draconia** guides through the Mountains (Fire)
- **Maylinn** guides through the Valley of Making (Heart)
- **Elara** guides through the Desert (Shift)
- **Shinkami** waits in the Highlands (Source)

The Guardians have traversed these territories. They know the way. Seek them in meditation when you are lost.
