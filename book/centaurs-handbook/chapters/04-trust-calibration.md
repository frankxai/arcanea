# Chapter IV: Trust Calibration

> *"The Centaur who trusts the AI too much becomes its passenger. The one who trusts too little rides alone."*

## The Trust Spectrum

### Under-Trust

**Symptoms**:
- Re-checking every AI output obsessively
- Never using AI for important work
- Treating AI as unreliable by default
- Missing opportunities for leverage

**Cost**: Wasted time, missed potential, exhaustion from overwork.

### Over-Trust

**Symptoms**:
- Accepting AI outputs without review
- Using AI for tasks requiring judgment
- Ignoring AI's known limitations
- Delegating decisions to AI

**Cost**: Errors in final work, loss of authentic voice, missing context.

## Calibrated Trust

The goal: **Trust that matches reality**.

### What AI Does Well (Trust More)

- Pattern recognition and application
- Volume generation for human selection
- Structure and organization
- First drafts and rough versions
- Research synthesis
- Grammar and style consistency
- Exploring possibility spaces

### What AI Does Poorly (Trust Less)

- Factual accuracy (always verify)
- Subtle judgment calls
- Understanding your specific context
- Knowing what you really want
- Emotional authenticity
- Novel creative breakthroughs
- Ethical decisions

## The Verification Protocol

```
LEVEL 1: SKIM (Low stakes)
Quick scan for obvious issues.
Trust: 80%

LEVEL 2: REVIEW (Medium stakes)
Read carefully, check key claims.
Trust: 60%

LEVEL 3: VERIFY (High stakes)
Independent verification of facts.
Cross-check with sources.
Trust: 30%

LEVEL 4: ASSUME ERROR (Critical)
Verify everything independently.
AI is starting point only.
Trust: 10%
```

---

## Trust Adjustment Over Time

```
NEW AI/TASK:
Start with low trust.
Verify heavily.
Build calibration.

ESTABLISHED AI/TASK:
Trust based on track record.
Spot-check rather than full verify.
Watch for edge cases.

DOMAIN SHIFT:
Reset to lower trust.
AI capabilities vary by domain.
Recalibrate for new territory.
```

*"Trust is not a feeling. It is a calibration, refined through experience, adjusted through evidence."*
