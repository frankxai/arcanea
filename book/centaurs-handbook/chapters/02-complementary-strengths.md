## Deep Dive: Human Strengths

### 1. Vision

**What it means:**
Knowing what you want to create, even when you can't fully articulate it.

**Why humans excel:**
```
Vision requires:
• Desire (humans want things)
• Purpose (humans have goals)
• Meaning (humans seek significance)
• Taste (humans recognize quality)

AI has none of these. AI has capability without desire.
```

**In practice:**
```
Human: "I want a story that feels like autumn—melancholy but not sad,
       with that specific feeling of knowing summer is over."

This is vision. AI can execute it, but only a human can have it.
```

### 2. Taste

**What it means:**
The ability to recognize quality, beauty, rightness—even when you can't explain why.

**Why humans excel:**
```
Taste is evaluative judgment:
• "This version is better" (but why?)
• "That word is wrong" (but grammatically correct)
• "Something's missing" (but what?)
• "Now it's right" (but how do you know?)

Taste cannot be algorithmic. It is human.
```

**In practice:**
```
AI generates five options.
Human's taste says: "Option 3, but with the ending from Option 1."

That judgment is irreplaceable.
```

### 3. Emotional Truth

**What it means:**
Drawing from genuine human experience to create authentic emotional resonance.

**Why humans excel:**
```
Emotional truth comes from:
• Having lived
• Having suffered
• Having loved
• Having lost
• Having hoped

AI can simulate emotion. Humans embody it.
```

**In practice:**
```
A character loses a parent.

AI: "She felt sad. The world seemed empty."
