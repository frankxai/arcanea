# Chapter III: The Modes of Collaboration

> *"The Centaur does not have one gait. It runs, walks, trots, and gallops as the terrain demands."*

## The Four Fundamental Modes

### Mode 1: Generator-Editor

**The Dance**: AI generates, Human selects and refines.

**Best For**: Brainstorming, first drafts, exploring possibilities, when human has strong taste but blank page.

**Human Role**: Define space, set criteria, evaluate, select, guide refinement.

**AI Role**: Generate options rapidly, explore widely, vary approaches, refine based on selection.

---

### Mode 2: Divergent-Convergent

**The Dance**: Alternating expansion and contraction.

**Best For**: Problem-solving, strategic planning, design work, when scope is uncertain.

**The Pattern**:
1. DIVERGE: AI explores widely, human observes
2. CONVERGE: Human identifies promising areas
3. DIVERGE: AI goes deep in selected areas
4. CONVERGE: Human synthesizes insights
5. Repeat until resolution

### Mode 3: Scaffold-Populate

**The Dance**: AI creates structure, Human fills with meaning.

**Best For**: Complex documents, presentations, analysis, when structure matters.

**Human Role**: Provide content, voice, key insights.

**AI Role**: Create frameworks, organize, ensure completeness.

---

### Mode 4: Draft-Polish

**The Dance**: Human creates, AI refines.

**Best For**: Preserving human voice, editing, proofreading, when authenticity is paramount.

**Human Role**: Create core content with authentic voice.

**AI Role**: Polish, catch errors, suggest improvements.

## Choosing the Right Mode

| Situation | Recommended Mode |
|-----------|------------------|
| Blank page | Generator-Editor |
| Complex problem | Divergent-Convergent |
| Long document | Scaffold-Populate |
| Personal writing | Draft-Polish |

---

## Mode Transitions

The skilled Centaur shifts modes fluidly:

```
Start in Generator-Editor for ideas
→ Shift to Scaffold-Populate for structure
→ Use Draft-Polish for final refinement
```

The mode serves the work. When one stops serving, shift to another.

*"The mark of mastery is knowing which mode to use—and when to change."*
