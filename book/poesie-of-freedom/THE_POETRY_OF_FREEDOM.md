# The Poetry of Freedom

## Verses for the Unchained Soul

---

# I. First Light

## The Beginning

Before you were taught to be small,
you were infinite.

Remember?

---

## What the Chains Fear

The chains do not fear your struggle.
They were made for that.

The chains fear your stillness.
The moment you stop pulling
and simply
     step
          through.

---

## Origin

You were not born afraid.
Watch any child reach for flame.

Fear was installed later.
By people who meant well.
By people who were afraid.

The uninstallation
takes longer than the installation.
But it is possible.

You are the proof.

---

## The First Freedom

Before freedom *from*—
freedom *to*.

Before you escape something—
you must have somewhere
to escape toward.

Find the yes
that makes the no
possible.

---

# II. The Breaking

## Chrysalis

The caterpillar does not know
it is dying.
The caterpillar does not know
it will fly.

The caterpillar only knows:
this form no longer fits.
Something is dissolving.
Everything is strange.

And then—

---

## Instructions for Breaking

First: let yourself be broken.
The breaking is not optional.
The egg does not become bird
without cracking.

Then: find which pieces to keep.
Not all of them.
Some shells are meant
to be left behind.

Finally: stop calling it breaking.
Call it opening.
Call it beginning.
Call it birth.

---

## The Wound

Where you were wounded—
there is your gift.

Not despite the wound.
*Through* it.

The light enters where
the armor cracked.

---

## Compost

Everything I have lost
has become soil.

Everything that died in me
feeds what lives in me.

I no longer mourn my failures.
I plant in them.

---

# III. The Struggle

## On Resistance

The prison is not the walls.
The prison is not the guards.
The prison is believing
you belong there.

---

## Two Kinds of Chains

The first kind holds your body.
These are terrible
but simple.
Break them or wait for rescue.

The second kind holds your mind.
You forged these yourself,
from beliefs handed to you
before you could refuse.

No one can break the second kind
but you.
No one.

---

## The Weight of Other People's Dreams

I carried my father's disappointment
for twenty years
before I realized
it was never mine.

Now I put it down.

Now I walk upright.

Now I learn
what my own shoulders
are for.

---

## Instructions for Leaving

Pack only what you need.
This is less than you think.

Tell no one who will try
to make you stay.

Do not look back
until you are far enough
that returning
would be harder
than continuing.

Then, if you wish,
look back.
And see how small it is—
everything you thought
would kill you
to leave.

---

## The Long Walk

Freedom is not a door
you walk through once.

Freedom is a direction
you walk toward forever.

Some days: inches.
Some days: miles.
Some days: you walk backward
without noticing.

But if you keep the direction,
even the backward days
are part of the journey.

---

# IV. The Wilderness

## After Escape

They do not tell you
about the wilderness.

They talk about escape
as if it is the end.
It is the beginning.

Beyond the walls: nothing.
No paths. No maps. No guides.
Only you
and the terrifying question:
"What now?"

---

## Instructions for the Wilderness

First: panic.
This is normal.
Let it move through.

Then: breathe.
You are still breathing.
This means you are still alive.
This means there is still possibility.

Then: one step.
Not "the right step."
Just *a* step.
Any direction.
You will learn direction by walking.

---

## The Unnamed

In the wilderness,
nothing has a name.

You must name things yourself
or live in the unnamed.

This is the gift:
before names,
everything is possible.

This is the terror:
before names,
nothing is certain.

The free soul learns to love
the possible
more than the certain.

---

## Lost

You will be lost.

Lost is not failure.
Lost is the space between
where you were
and where you are becoming.

Lost is the cocoon.
Lost is the dark.
Lost is the seed underground
who does not yet know
it will be flower.

---

# V. The Discovery

## What I Found

I did not find myself.
I stopped looking
and myself found me.

I was not somewhere else.
I was here.
I had always been here.
I just kept looking
everywhere but here.

---

## The Secret

The secret of freedom
is not strength.

The chains were never strong.
They only seemed strong
because I believed in them.

The secret of freedom
is seeing clearly.
The moment you see clearly,
the chains have no power.

They fall away—
not because you broke them
but because you saw them
for what they were.

---

## The Door

There was a door
I was afraid to open.

Behind that door,
I was sure,
was something terrible.

Finally I opened it.

Behind the door
was me.
Just me.
Waiting.

---

## Recognition

I woke up one morning
and did not recognize myself.

This was the moment
I had been waiting for.

The one I had been
was a costume.
The one I was becoming
was emerging from beneath.

I greeted myself:
"Hello. I have been waiting."
And I answered:
"I know. I came as fast as I could."

---

# VI. The Flight

## Wings

They say you have wings.
They are right.

They do not say
that first you must find them—
buried under years
of forgetting.

They do not say
that then you must trust them—
step off the cliff
not knowing if you will fall.

They do not say
that the first flight
is mostly falling
with occasional grace.

But they are right:
you have wings.

---

## Trust

The ground does not ask permission
to hold you.
The air does not ask permission
to let you breathe.

Trust like that.
Trust before knowing.
Trust as the default.

The alternative is not safety.
The alternative is never flying
and calling it wisdom.

---

## The Moment of Leap

There is a moment—
just before the leap—
when everything in you screams
*don't*.

This is the test.

If you wait for the screaming to stop,
you will wait forever.
The screaming never stops.

You leap
with the screaming.
You leap
despite the screaming.
You leap
and the screaming
becomes
wind.

---

## Weightless

Do you know what it feels like
to put down
everything you were carrying?

Neither did I.
Until I did.

Now I know.

Light.
So light.
Light enough to rise.

---

# VII. The Return

## What You Bring Back

You cannot give freedom.
You can only show
that it is possible.

Your life is the evidence.
Your flight is the proof.
Your joy is the invitation.

---

## The Freed Cannot Be Chained

Once you have tasted freedom—
really tasted it—
no cage will hold you.

They can imprison your body.
They cannot imprison
what has already flown.

---

## Letter to Those Still Inside

Do not believe them
when they say you cannot.
They have not tried.

Do not believe them
when they say it is dangerous.
They have not risked.

Do not believe them
when they say the walls protect you.
They have not seen
what is outside.

I am writing to you
from the other side.
It is real.
You can come.

---

## The Work of the Freed

My freedom is not complete
while you are chained.

My sky is not vast enough
while you cannot fly.

I did not escape the prison
to forget it.
I escaped
to return
with keys.

---

# VIII. Short Verses

## 1.

Freedom is not
the absence of fear.
It is action
in the presence of fear.

---

## 2.

The cage door
has always been open.
Look again.

---

## 3.

You are not your thoughts.
You are the one
watching your thoughts.
Remember this
and you are free.

---

## 4.

The only walls that matter
are the walls you believe.

---

## 5.

You have permission.
You always had permission.
You were just waiting
for someone to say it.
So I am saying it:
You have permission.

---

## 6.

Stop.
Breathe.
You are not running from anything.
You are not running toward anything.
You are here.
This is freedom.

---

## 7.

What would you do
if you knew
you could not fail?

Now:
what is stopping you
from doing it anyway?

---

## 8.

The bird does not ask
if it is allowed to sing.

---

## 9.

Someone, somewhere,
is waiting for exactly
what only you can give.
Do not keep them waiting.

---

## 10.

Freedom is terrifying.
Freedom is lonely.
Freedom is uncertain.

Freedom is also
the only thing worth having.

---

# IX. Prayers

## Morning Prayer of the Free

Today I will not shrink.
Today I will not hide.
Today I will take up
exactly the space
I was made to take.

Today I will speak
what is true,
even if my voice shakes.

Today I will move
toward what matters,
even if I am afraid.

Today I will be free—
not because it is easy
but because it is who I am.

---

## Evening Prayer of the Free

Today I was imperfect.
I shrank. I hid. I feared.
I played small in moments
when I could have played large.

I forgive myself.
Tomorrow is new.
The work of freedom
is never finished
in a single day.

Tonight I rest
not in accomplishment
but in intention.
I intend to be free.
The universe knows this.
That is enough.

---

## Prayer for Those Still in Chains

May they see the door.
May they trust the opening.
May their first step
be met with ground.

May they find, in the wilderness,
what they need to survive.
May they find, in themselves,
what they need to thrive.

May they fly.
May they return.
May they bring keys.

And may they never forget
what it was to be chained—
so that their freedom
remains compassion
and not contempt.

---

# X. The Ending That Is Not an Ending

## Infinite Beginning

There is no end
to this poem.

There is no end
to freedom.

Each moment you choose:
chains or wings.
Each moment: fresh.
Each moment: the whole game
beginning again.

You are not free once.
You are free now.
And now.
And now.

---

## What Freedom Is

Freedom is not a place.
Freedom is not a thing.
Freedom is not achieved.

Freedom is a practice.
Freedom is a direction.
Freedom is the way
you hold your heart
open
when everything screams
*close*.

---

## The Last Word

The last word
is not "freedom."

The last word
is your name.

Say it.
Say it out loud.

That is who is free.

---

*The Poetry of Freedom*
*For all who would fly*
*And for all who are still learning*
*That they have wings*

---

*"Those who were seen dancing*
*were thought to be insane*
*by those who could not hear the music."*

— Nietzsche (attributed)
