## Welcome to the Library

You have entered the Library of Arcanea—the collected wisdom of the realm of creation. These texts have been gathered across ages, preserved by the Archives of the Arcanea Academy, and now offered to all who seek.

This is not a library you read through. This is a library you live with. Some books will call to you now. Others will wait until you are ready. All will be here when you need them.

## The Library's Promise

If you read these texts honestly—
If you let them question you as you question them—
If you apply what resonates and release what doesn't—

You will change.

Not because the texts have magic power, but because engagement with wisdom changes those who engage. You are not the same person who reads as the person who finishes. The Library does not fill you with knowledge. It expands your capacity to receive.
