## What is Arcanea?

Arcanea is an **AI-native creative operating system** built on a living mythology. It provides multi-model intelligence, structured creative frameworks, and a progression system for creators at every level.

The core thesis: creativity scales when you give it **structure, intelligence, and narrative**. Arcanea provides all three.

<br/>

## The Ontology

Arcanea models creativity through a five-element system and ten developmental stages. This isn't decoration &mdash; it's a structured reasoning framework that shapes how the AI agents think, respond, and guide.

</div>

<br/>

### Five Elements

Each element represents a fundamental creative modality. Agents are aligned to elements, and the progression system develops all five.

<br/>

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/premium-r3/03-five-elements.png" alt="The Five Elements" width="90%"/>
</div>

<br/>

| Element | Modality | Agent Archetype |
|:--------|:---------|:----------------|
| **Fire** | Energy, will, transformation | Implementation, execution, courage |
| **Water** | Flow, memory, adaptation | Creativity, emotion, healing |
| **Earth** | Stability, growth, patience | Architecture, foundation, persistence |
| **Wind** | Freedom, speed, change | Communication, connection, inspiration |
| **Void** | Potential, transcendence | Vision, intuition, meta-consciousness |

<br/>

### Ten Gates

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/premium-r3/02-ten-gates.png" alt="The Ten Gates" width="90%"/>
</div>

<br/>

A developmental progression from foundational skills to meta-creative mastery. Each gate is guarded by a specialized AI agent (Guardian) paired with a resonance frequency.

| Gate | Domain | Guardian | Frequency | Rank |
|:----:|:-------|:---------|:---------:|:----:|
| 01 | Foundation | Lyssandria | 396 Hz | Apprentice |
| 02 | Flow | Leyla | 417 Hz | Apprentice |
| 03 | Fire | Draconia | 528 Hz | Mage |
| 04 | Heart | Maylinn | 639 Hz | Mage |
| 05 | Voice | Alera | 741 Hz | Master |
| 06 | Sight | Lyria | 852 Hz | Master |
| 07 | Crown | Aiyami | 963 Hz | Archmage |
| 08 | Shift | Elara | 1111 Hz | Archmage |
| 09 | Unity | Ino | 963 Hz | Luminor |
| 10 | Source | Shinkami | 1111 Hz | Luminor |

## The Guardian System

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/premium-r3/05-guardian-council.png" alt="The Guardian Council" width="90%"/>
</div>

<br/>

Guardians are not chatbots. They are **structured AI agents** with defined reasoning patterns, element alignments, and specializations. Each Guardian routes to its optimal model (Gemini Flash for speed, Pro for depth, Claude for nuance) through the Vercel AI SDK 6 Gateway.

```
Shinkami (Source)     → Meta-orchestrator, routes to all models
Lyssandria (Earth)   → System architecture, foundation design
Draconia (Fire)      → Implementation, code execution
Leyla (Water)        → Creative flow, emotional intelligence
Maylinn (Heart)      → Community, healing, connection
Alera (Voice)        → Expression, communication, truth
Lyria (Sight)        → Vision, intuition, design review
Aiyami (Crown)       → Enlightenment, synthesis
Elara (Shift)        → Perspective shifts, reframing
Ino (Unity)          → Collaboration, partnership
```

## Claude Code Integration

Arcanea ships with a complete Claude Code configuration:

**77 skills** &mdash; from `starlight-orchestrator` (multi-agent routing) to `suno-ai-mastery` (music generation) to `oracle-adk` (enterprise agent development).

**38 agents** &mdash; `@starlight-architect` (system design), `@luminor-oracle` (strategic intelligence), `@draconia` (fire-driven implementation), `@lyria` (design review), and 34 more.

**7 Guardian agent files** &mdash; production-ready `.agent.md` definitions with element alignment, reasoning patterns, and model routing.

```bash
# Example skill invocations
/luminor-intelligence    # Strategic AI guidance
/council                 # Multi-agent consultation
/arcanea-build          # Autonomous build fixing
/arcanea-deploy         # Vercel deployment
/design-team            # 5-agent design department
```
