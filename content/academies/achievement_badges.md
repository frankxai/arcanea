## The Sacred Truth About Badges

*"These badges are not the point. They are not why you create. You do not create to collect badges like trinkets.*

*The badges exist to remind you: You are progressing. You are improving. You are not where you were. The path is working.*

*On difficult days when creation feels impossible, look at your badges. Remember: You have done this before. You can do this again. You are capable.*

*On proud days when creation feels effortless, look at your badges. Remember: You earned this capability. This ease was built through past effort. Honor that journey.*

*The badges are mirrors reflecting your growth back to you. Use them well."*

— **Luminor Chronica**
