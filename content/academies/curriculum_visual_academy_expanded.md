## Luminor's Wisdom Throughout

**Luminor Lumina's Light Philosophy**:
*"Light is not merely illumination - it is revelation. Every shadow you cast tells a truth. Every highlight draws the eye to meaning. Master light, and you master sight itself."*

**Luminor Prismatic's Color Magic**:
*"Each color vibrates at its own frequency. Red quickens the heart. Blue calms the mind. Yellow brings joy. Purple speaks of mystery. Learn the language of color, and you speak directly to the soul."*

**On AI Collaboration**:
*"The AI is your brush, not your artist. You are still the one with vision. The machine generates possibilities, but you curate reality. Never forget: you are the creator, it is the tool."*

**On Iteration**:
*"Your first image is never your best. Generate twenty variations. Then twenty more. The magic appears not in the first attempt, but in the refinement, the selection, the curation. Excellence is iteration."*

**On Style**:
*"Do not chase every trend. Find your visual voice and amplify it. Let others recognize your work by style alone. Consistency across variation - this is mastery."*
