## ‚ö° CRITICAL PATH: What To Do NOW

### Option A: Use the Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/Frank/Arcanea/Arcanea Technical Architecture"
./EXECUTE_NOW.sh
```
This will:
- Set up your MVP structure
- Create all necessary files
- Prepare for deployment
- Give you a working chat interface

### Option B: Manual Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Create MVP
npx create-next-app@latest arcanea --typescript --tailwind --app
cd arcanea

# 2. Add OpenRouter
npm install openai

# 3. Deploy
vercel --prod

# 4. Iterate
```

### Option C: Use Morphic/v0
1. Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. Prompt: "Create an AI chat interface with character selection"
3. Export and customize
4. Deploy to Vercel

3. **THIS WEEK**
   - Add character creation
   - Integrate payments
   - Launch on Product Hunt
   - Get 100 beta users

4. **THIS MONTH**
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Add premium features
   - Scale to 1,000 users
   - Achieve $3K MRR

## DON'T DO THIS:

## üí° ONE QUESTION TO ANSWER

### Should you consolidate into one platform or keep multiple apps?

**Answer**: Start with ONE app (Next.js web), validate product-market fit, THEN expand to multiple apps. Your current multi-app approach is premature optimization.

### Should you go full open source or hybrid?

**Answer**: HYBRID. Open source the tools and components, keep business logic private. This builds community while protecting revenue.

### Should you use the Morphic/v0 approach?

**Answer**: YES for UI components, but build your own AI integration. Morphic/v0 gives you beautiful UI fast, OpenRouter gives you AI flexibility.
