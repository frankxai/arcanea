# Characters Index

This directory contains all character entities for this world.

## Organization

Each character has their own directory:
```
characters/
└── [character-name]/
    ├── profile.md (or profile.arc)
    ├── backstory.arc
    └── relationships.arc
```

## Character Types

- **Protagonists** - Main heroes of stories
- **Antagonists** - Primary opponents
- **Supporting** - Key secondary characters
- **Minor** - Background characters
- **NPCs** - Quest givers, merchants, guards, etc

## Guidelines

- Every character needs a birthplace (link to geography)
- Every character belongs to a culture
- Define at least 3 relationships per character
- Ensure ages align with timeline
- Validate with Character Weaver agent
