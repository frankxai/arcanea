# Create Character Workflow

This workflow guides you through creating a rich, consistent character using the **character-weaver** agent.

## Step 1: Character Concept

Provide a 1-2 sentence concept for your character:

**Example**: "A warrior haunted by the war they won, now seeking redemption through protecting others"

**Your Concept**:
[Describe your character idea here]

## Step 2: World Context

Which world is this character for?
**World Name**: [Enter world name]

Where in the world are they from?
**Birthplace**: [Location name]

What culture do they belong to?
**Culture**: [Culture name]

## Step 3: Agent Coordination

I will now:

1. Use the **character-weaver** agent to generate a comprehensive character profile
2. Validate against world consistency with **lore-master**
3. Create relationship mappings
4. Generate the character .arc file with proper metadata
5. Link to relevant locations, cultures, and conflicts
6. Add to `characters/_index.md`

The character will be created in: `characters/[character-slug]/profile.md`
