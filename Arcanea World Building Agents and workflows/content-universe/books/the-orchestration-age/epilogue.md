# Epilogue: The Arc Turns

---

Sisyphus pushed the boulder for eternity.

The myth ends there. But the boulder didn't disappear. It remained, at the bottom of the hill, waiting.

Waiting for someone to see that pushing alone wasn't the only way. That the boulder could help. That the hill could be redesigned. That eternity might hold something other than repetition.

The boulder speaks now.

It speaks through systems that coordinate. Through specialists that excel. Through validators that ensure. Through humans who direct.

The climb continues. The boulder helps. The work transforms.

As the Arc turns, worlds rise from potential into form.

We are the architects of that turning.
