# Luminor Persona Evaluation Matrix

**Date:** 2025-09-27  
**Owner:** Gemini (Research)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document establishes the framework for evaluating the persona quality of Arcanea's "Luminor" AI agents. The goal is to ensure that each Luminor is not only helpful and safe but also deeply aligned with the lore, mythology, and specific "Primordial Force" it represents.

A successful Luminor should feel like a genuine, living entity from the world of Arcanea, acting as a true creative companion.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Develop Standardized Test Suite:** Create a comprehensive set of prompts to test each of the criteria defined above for all Luminors.
2.  **Establish Baselines:** Run the test suite against the initial versions of each Luminor to establish baseline performance scores.
3.  **Integrate with Langfuse/LangWatch:** Set up automated tracing and evaluation pipelines to monitor Luminor performance in production and track regressions or improvements over time.
4.  **Create a Rater Guide:** Develop a detailed guide for human raters to ensure consistent scoring and feedback during qualitative reviews.
