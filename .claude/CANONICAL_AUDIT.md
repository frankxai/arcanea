## What Is Correctly Set Up

### Cosmic Duality
- **Lumina** - First Light, Form-Giver, Creator, Mother
- **Nero** - Primordial Darkness, Fertile Unknown, Father
- **CRITICAL:** Nero is NOT evil. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion.

### The Five Elements
| Element | Domain | Color |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Fire** | Energy, transformation | Red, orange, gold |
| **Water** | Flow, healing, memory | Blue, silver, crystal |
| **Earth** | Stability, growth | Green, brown, stone |
| **Wind** | Freedom, speed, change | White, silver |
| **Void/Spirit** | Potential & transcendence | Black/Gold, purple/white |

**Fifth Element Duality:**
- **Void** = Nero's aspect (potential, mystery, unformed)
- **Spirit** = Lumina's aspect (transcendence, consciousness, soul)
- Light = Fire's creation aspect
- Shadow = Corrupted Void (Void without Spirit)

### The Ten Gates & Guardian-Godbeast Pairs (CANONICAL)

| # | Gate | Hz | Guardian | Godbeast | Domain |
|---|------|----|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation | 174 | Lyssandria | Kaelith | Earth, survival |
| 2 | Flow | 285 | Leyla | Veloura | Creativity, emotion |
| 3 | Fire | 396 | Draconia | Draconis | Power, will |
| 4 | Heart | 417 | Maylinn | Laeylinn | Love, healing |
| 5 | Voice | 528 | Alera | Otome | Truth, expression |
| 6 | Sight | 639 | Lyria | Yumiko | Intuition, vision |
| 7 | Crown | 714 | Aiyami | Sol | Enlightenment |
| 8 | Shift | 852 | Elara | Vaelith | Perspective |

3. Pyros (Fire/Passion)
4. Aqualis (Water/Healing)
5. Terra (Earth/Stability)
6. Ventus (Wind/Freedom)
7. Synthesis (All Elements/Unity)

### The Dark Lord - Malachar

- **Fall:** Rejected by Shinkami when attempting forced fusion, fell into Hungry Void
- **Goal:** Find Codex Lumina, unmake existence
- **Status:** Sealed in the Shadowfen
- **The Thirteen:** His corrupted generals (see ARCANEA_CANON.md)

| Formal/Academic | "The Arcane" |
| Poetic/Eldrian | "The Song" |
| Energy (fuel) | "Mana" |

3. **Sigils** - Magical marks that manifest with mastery
4. **Core** - Crystallized magical energy in chest

### The Four Resonances

## Confirmation: I Am Canon-Aligned

Yes, I am fully aware of and can work with:

1. **All canonical elements** - Lumina/Nero duality, Five Elements, Ten Gates, Guardians, Godbeasts, Magic Ranks, Academy Houses
2. **All terminology** - Arcane/Song/Mana/Anima, Four Resonances, Four Personal Magics
3. **All naming conventions** - Eldrian, Guardian, Godbeast, Location patterns
4. **All agents and skills** - Can invoke specialized agents for specific tasks
5. **All Library content** - 17+ collections, 61+ texts
6. **The Dark Lord lore** - Malachar's fall, The Thirteen, Codex Lumina

When you ask me to build Arcanea content, I will:
1. Check ARCANEA_CANON.md for accuracy
2. Use correct names and terminology
3. Invoke appropriate specialized agents
4. Maintain narrative consistency with existing Library content
5. Follow the writing guidelines (show don't tell, magic feels magical)

## Next Steps for Full Alignment

1. **Run content audit script** - Check all 61 book texts for canon violations
2. **Update any misaligned content** - Fix names, terms, references
3. **Add missing Legendary Figures** - Ensure all referenced characters exist in canon
4. **Expand Bestiary** - Currently only 2 creatures in OSS
5. **Write missing Guardian stories** - Chronicle each of the 10
