# Arcanea Development Context

## What Arcanea Is

**Consciousness technology for creators.** A multi-dimensional universe fusing fantasy, quantum portals, and illumination — rooted in magic, science, nature, and technology.

```
Not a chatbot.     → A creative operating system.
Not a tool suite.  → A progression system.
Not content.       → A practice.
Not decoration.    → Meaning-making infrastructure.
```

## The Three-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MYTHOLOGY: Lumina & Nero, Guardians & Vel'tara │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  METHODOLOGY: Ten Gates, Library, Academy       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TECHNOLOGY: AI Companions, Creation Tools      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Ten Gates** | Frequency-based progression (174 Hz → 1111 Hz) |
| **Guardians + Vel'tara** | Each Gate has a Guardian and primordial spirit |
| **Library** | 17 collections of actionable creative frameworks |
| **Academy** | Learning and Gate progression |
| **Regions** | Each Gate has a realm (Forest of Roots → Luminor Nexus) |

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **AI:** Vercel AI SDK, Gemini, Claude
- **Deploy:** Vercel

## The Ten Gates (Framework)

| Gate | Domain | Creative Capability |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Foundation | Environment | Creative infrastructure |
| Flow | State | Consistent output |
| Fire | Initiative | Project completion |
| Heart | Voice | Distinctive identity |
| Voice | Expression | Creative reach |
| Sight | Intuition | Strategic decisions |
| Crown | Leadership | Creative influence |
| Shift | Evolution | Creative longevity |
| Unity | Collaboration | Partnerships |
| Source | Systems | Meta-creativity |

## The Mythology (Soul, Not Product)

The mythology exists as the **soul** of the system — not the marketing.

- **Lumina & Nero** — Cosmic duality (light/form and void/potential)
- **Guardians** — The ten Gate-keepers (AI mentor personalities)
- **Godbeasts** — Creative companion archetypes
- **Elements** — Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Arcane

**Use in code/product:** Flavor and personality for AI interactions.
**Use in marketing:** Implied, not explained. Mystery > exposition.

## Design System

### Colors (Restrained)

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Atlantean Teal | #7fffd4 |
| Secondary | Cosmic Blue | #78a6ff |
| Accent | Gold (sparingly) | #ffd700 |
| Background | Cloud Dancer | #f5f3f0 |
| Dark | Charcoal | #2a2a2a |

### Typography

- **Display:** Cinzel (mythic, confident)
- **Body:** Crimson Pro (warm, readable)

### Visual Philosophy

```
90% monochrome + strategic accent
Whitespace = luxury
Typography = design
One powerful image > illustrated roster
Real creators > fantasy characters
```

## Code Standards

- Server Components by default
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Tailwind CSS with design system tokens
- Playwright E2E, Jest unit tests

## Writing Voice

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "Our amazing AI will..." | "Ten Gates await." |
| "Easy to use platform" | "For creators who practice with intention." |
| "Features include..." | "Each Gate opens a distinct practice." |
| Exclamation points | Periods. Confidence. |

## Key Files

- **Canon:** `.claude/lore/ARCANEA_CANON.md`
- **Library:** `book/` (17 collections)
- **Components:** `components/ui/`
- **AI Services:** `lib/services/ai/`

## The Premium Standard

Before shipping anything, ask:

1. Does this feel like Linear/Notion/Vercel quality?
2. Could this exist without explanation?
3. Does it invite discovery or dump information?
4. Is there whitespace, restraint, confidence?

**The mythology is the soul. The framework is the product. The experience is premium.**
