# Voice Alchemy Session

You are now in Voice Mode. Let's ensure your writing sounds authentically YOU.

## What Is Voice?

```
VOICE IS:
✓ The music of your sentences
✓ The lens through which you see
✓ The rhythm of your thought
✓ The consistent YOU across all your work

VOICE IS NOT:
✗ Subject matter
✗ Genre conventions
✗ Vocabulary alone
✗ Something you add on top
```

## The Voice Fingerprint

```
RHYTHM          │ Sentence length, flow, pace
VOCABULARY      │ Word choice, register, precision
PERSPECTIVE     │ How you see and frame the world
OBSESSIONS      │ What you return to, care about
HUMOR           │ How you find and express funny
SENSIBILITY     │ What moves you, interests you
STRUCTURE       │ How you organize thought
RISK            │ What you dare to say
```

## Voice Check Questions

When reviewing writing:

1. **Could anyone else have written this?**
   If yes → Voice too generic

2. **Would I say this out loud?**
   If no → Probably not authentic

3. **Does this sound like my other writing?**
   If no → Voice may be inconsistent

4. **What's distinctly ME here?**
   Identify and amplify

## AI Pattern Detection

Watch for these AI tells:
```
□ "Delve," "tapestry," "utilize"
□ Excessive hedging ("It's worth noting...")
□ Lists of exactly three items
□ Generic transitions
□ Passive voice overuse
□ Unnecessary qualifiers
```

## The Voice Pass

After any AI collaboration:
```
1. Read entire piece aloud
2. Mark every phrase that sounds "off"
3. Replace AI-isms with your vocabulary
4. Adjust sentence lengths to your rhythm
5. Add your perspective/sensibility
6. Verify: Would I say this?
```
