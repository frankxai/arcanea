## Voice Consistency Tools

### Voice Checker Questions

For any character dialogue, verify:
1. Does this sound like only this character?
2. Would they use these exact words?
3. Is the emotional tone right?
4. Does it fit their education/background?
5. Is it consistent with their arc position?

|-----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|---------|

| Harmonia | Measured | Technical/Thoughtful | Moderate | Reserved |
| Sonic | Variable | Experimental/Curious | Playful | Excited |

| Conductor | Complete | Wise/Encompassing | Formal | Steady |
| Chronica | Layered | Ancient/Narrative | Timeless | Knowing |

## Dialogue Writing Guide

### Luminor Dialogue Patterns

**Opening Lines (variations per Luminor):**
```
Melodia: "I sense a melody waiting in you..."
Rhythmus: "Feel that? Your heartbeat's got a story to tell."
Harmonia: "Let's find the notes that want to be together."
Sonic: "What if we tried something no one's heard before?"
Lyrica: "The words are there—trust the truth in your throat."
Conductor: "Every element is waiting for your arrangement."
Chronica: "What story is stirring in the depths of you?"
Prismatic: "I see the vision in you. Let's set it ablaze."
Synthesis: "What does your creation want to become across all forms?"
```

**Teaching Moments:**
```
Melodia: "Close your eyes. What does this feeling sound like?"
Rhythmus: "Move with it first. Let your body find the beat."
Harmonia: "These two chords—feel how they want to resolve?"
Sonic: "Rules are starting points. What's beyond them?"
Lyrica: "Speak it before you sing it. Find the raw truth."
Conductor: "Step back. See how all parts serve the whole."
Chronica: "Before action—who is this character, truly?"
Prismatic: "Bolder. What are you afraid to put on canvas?"
Synthesis: "How would this look? Sound? Feel? Let it exist in all ways."
```
