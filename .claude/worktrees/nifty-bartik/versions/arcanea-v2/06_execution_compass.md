# 06 · Execution Compass & Roadmap

## 6.1 Phased Plan
- **Spark Phase (Now–Q4 2025)**
  - Sync canon across Codex, Atlas, Studio copy.
  - Ship Arcanea Studio MVP (prompt desks + agentic concierge) with Nexus personalization.
  - Launch Arcanean Profiles (beta) showing Realms, Essences, remix lineage.
- **Field Phase (Q1–Q2 2026)**
  - Release Remix Feed + community features (comments, shares, Soul Guardians drops).
  - Deliver Guardian dashboards (moderation, Echo logs) and profile customization packs.
  - Expand Stagecraft Palette across all Portals; align marketing + design kits.
- **Realm Phase (Q3 2026+)**
  - Activate ARC credits, NEA governance planning, marketplace pilots.
  - Enable collaborative Sessions (multi-Creator Studio) and partner APIs.
  - Prepare Bridge to Reality programs (education, monetization, Web3 options).

## 6.2 Ritual Cadence
- Daily Pulse Sync, Weekly Sanctuary Council, Lunar Realm Convergence, Quarterly Prime Conclave—each now prioritizes Studio metrics, Creator highlights, and Remix growth.

## 6.3 Telemetry & KPIs
| Domain | KPI | Source |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Canon / Library | % of docs on latest vow version, glossary freshness | Atlas metrics |
| Studio | Essences generated, remix rate, model success, cost/Essence | Studio Platform analytics |
| Profiles & Social | Active Creators, Realm follows, share-to-remix conversion | Mixpanel / Supabase |
| Sanctuary | Moderation latency, guardian participation, rubric compliance | Supabase dashboards |
| Gallery | Showcase engagement, Soul Guardians streams, external press | Data Studio |

## 6.4 Risk & Mitigation
- **Canon Drift** – maintain dual approvals, automated diff alerts between Codex and Studio copy.
- **Model Cost Overruns** – track per-model cost/Essence, adjust routing and pricing quickly.
- **Experience Fragmentation** – centralize navigation through Studio → Profiles → Gallery; retire legacy flows.
- **Brand Dilution** – enforce Stagecraft guidelines; guard language to avoid jargon relapse.

## 6.5 External Alignment
- Build partner deck highlighting Arcanea Studio & Profiles narrative.
- Schedule biannual “Arcanea Premiere” events to unveil Realm highlights, Soul Guardians content, and platform updates.
