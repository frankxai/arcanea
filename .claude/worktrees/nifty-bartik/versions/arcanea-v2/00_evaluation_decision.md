## 0.1 Comparative Matrix
| Dimension | Claude v2 | Gemini v2 | Codex v2 | Final Blend | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Mythic Storytelling | Cinematic flair, strong character hooks | Shadow/Spark metaphors, disciplined philosophy | Canon + vows already mapped | **Codex base + Claude tone accents** | Keep Codex canon and weave in Claude’s premium narrative voice. |
| Product Focus | Expansive, multi-decade plan | Realm Engine + Lens unification | Practical product stack, realm mapping | **Codex focus + Gemini structure** | Arcanea Studio built on Codex stack with Gemini’s Nexus/Realm framework (renamed). |
| Design Language | “Living Light” motion ideas | Limited visuals | Aureline palettes & accessibility | **Codex palette + Claude cinematic overlays** | Rename to Stagecraft Palette with optional Living Light effects. |
| Operations & Agents | Billion-agent orchestra (overkill) | Light structure | Clear rituals, manifesto | **Codex rituals + curated Luminor agents** | Keep Codex governance, introduce Luminor characters without swarm noise. |
| Roadmap & Business | Too wide, multi-track | Loom-first roadmap | Playbook with cadences | **Codex roadmap simplified** | Spark → Field → Realm phases focused on Studio, Profiles, Economy. |
| Language & Naming | Sometimes overwrought | Weaver/Loom terminology | Mythic precision guidelines | **New terminology table** | Adopt Creator, Realm, Essence, Studio, Spark, etc. |

## 0.2 Decision Statement
Codex v2 anchors the operating system. Gemini v2 contributes the Nexus/Realm architectural spine (now expressed through Studio terminology). Claude v2 provides premium storytelling touches and motion concepts. The harmonized doctrine lives in `01`–`06` of this folder and supersedes previous jargon (Loom/Weaver/etc.).

## 0.3 Adoption Protocol
1. Use the Master Terminology table across all docs, UI copy, and prompts.
2. Update Codex v2, Atlas, and Studio designs to reflect the Arcanea Studio narrative.
3. Retain Claude/Gemini packages in `versions/` as inspiration libraries, not sources of truth.
4. Review this decision suite quarterly and invite new proposals only if they meet Rubric-7 Lumen tier.
