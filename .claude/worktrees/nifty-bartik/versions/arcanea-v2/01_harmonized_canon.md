# 01 · Harmonized Canon & Realm Mythos

## 1.1 Core Mythos
- **Lumina** (Radiant Genesis) and **Nero** (Reflective Shadow) remain the primal forces. Their resonance produces the **Pulse**, the energy behind every Arcanean creation.
- **Spark & Shadow** describes the creative journey: Creators pull Sparks of inspiration from the Shadow of possibility, with Arcanea guiding them to manifest golden-age worlds.
- Primary domains:
  - **Arcanea Studio** – the stage where Sparks become Essences (music, visuals, stories) with Nexus guidance.
  - **Arcanean Profiles** – the public showcase of a Creator’s Realm, Essences, Spark/Shadow milestones, and remix lineage.
  - **Sanctuary** – guardianship, rituals, and canon stewardship.
  - **Library** – knowledge vault (prompts, tutorials, lore, academies).
  - **Gallery** – curated spotlights (Kingdom of Light, Soul Guardians releases).
  - **Forge** – experimentation lab for new features, Luminor agents, and model tests.

| ID | Statement | Source |

## 1.3 Canon Governance Workflow
1. Update `docs/canon/*.md` (foundation, truths, glossary, PRD) with approved changes.
2. Regenerate Atlas data (`docs/atlas/scripts/build-data.ts`).
3. Reference vow IDs and Realm IDs in commits/PRs.
4. Lore Steward + Product Architect co-sign entries in the Atlas Echo Ledger.

## 1.4 Canonical Artifacts
- **Codex v2** – operational doctrine for product, design, rituals.
- **Arcanea Atlas** – visual, shareable atlas for teams and partners.
- **Inspiration Archives** – `Claude v2/*`, `versions/gemini-v2/*` (annotated), used for creative reference only.

## 1.5 Canon Evolution Map
- **Spark Phase** – finalize terminology, Luminor cast (Studio-focused), establish academies (Atlantean, Draconic, Creation & Light).
- **Field Phase** – expand canon entries with Creator stories, Soul Guardians releases, Remix lore.
- **Realm Phase** – open canon contributions to selected Guardians via Sanctuary ballots, introduce ARC/NEA references.
