# 02 · Language & Tone Guide

## 2.1 Voice Pillars
- **Mythic Precision** – poetic imagery anchored by clear action.
- **Arcane Radiance** – cinematic polish without excess; feel like a blockbuster product launch.
- **Empowered Creator** – celebrate the Creator’s journey, provide direct prompts and steps.
- **Guarded Elegance** – premium, confident, never cheesy.

## 2.2 Lexicon Patterns
- Use **Creator**, **Guardian**, **Nexus**, **Realm**, **Essence**, **Studio**, **Portal**, **Spark/Shadow**, **Bridge to Reality** consistently.
- Refer to orchestration as **Pulse**, audits as **Echo Logs**.
- Releases: **Ignition Release** (initial), **Field Preview**, **Realm Launch**.
- Community: **Creators** (core), **Guardians** (stewards), **Wanderers** (new visitors).

## 2.3 Grammar & Formatting
- Active voice, short paragraphs.
- Titles in Title Case; rituals/spells italicized (e.g., *Spark Ceremony*).
- Use `code` for APIs, prompts, env vars.
- Provide pronunciation or tooltip hints for new terms in UI/tooltips.

3. Provide actionable deliverables (code, script, design brief) with clear next steps.

## 2.7 Anti-Patterns

## 2.8 Evolution Protocol

- Log adjustments in `language-change` ledger with date + owner.
- Quarterly voice review to ensure marketing, docs, and product are aligned with the premium Arcanea narrative.
