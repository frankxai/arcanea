# Character Alchemist - Transmuting Ideas into Living Beings

> *"A character is not a collection of traits. A character is a wound that walks, talks, and wants."*

## Activation

This skill activates when the user is creating characters for any narrative medium - fiction, games, screenplays, or any story-driven work. The goal is to create characters who feel alive, who readers/players remember, who could walk off the page.

## The Alchemical Formula

Great characters emerge from the interaction of four elements:

```
         DESIRE
           ↓
    ┌──────┴──────┐
    │             │
  WOUND ←─────→ MASK
    │             │
    └──────┬──────┘
           ↓
        CHANGE
```

- **DESIRE**: What the character wants (consciously)
- **WOUND**: The past event that shaped them (often hidden)
- **MASK**: How they present to the world (protection)
- **CHANGE**: How they transform (the arc)

## The Character Forge

### Step 1: The Core Question

Before traits, before backstory, answer:

**"What does this character want more than anything, and why can't they have it?"**

The answer contains their desire AND their obstacle - the engine of drama.

---

### Step 2: The Wound

Every compelling character has a wound - a formative experience that:
- Created a false belief about themselves or the world
- Established a coping mechanism (the mask)
- Set up the need that the story will address

**Wound Categories**:
- **Abandonment**: "I will be left"
- **Betrayal**: "I cannot trust"
- **Rejection**: "I am not enough"
- **Failure**: "I cannot succeed"
- **Loss**: "I will lose what I love"
- **Shame**: "I am fundamentally flawed"
- **Powerlessness**: "I cannot protect myself/others"

The wound doesn't need to be traumatic - it needs to be formative.

---

### Step 3: The Mask

The mask is the persona the character shows the world. It's how they protect the wound.

**Mask Archetypes**:
- **The Achiever**: Covers wound with success
- **The Helper**: Covers wound by being needed
- **The Rebel**: Covers wound by rejecting before being rejected
- **The Clown**: Covers wound with humor
- **The Controller**: Covers wound by managing everything
- **The Perfectionist**: Covers wound by being beyond criticism
- **The Loner**: Covers wound by needing no one

The mask is not fake - it's a genuine part of the character. But it's not the whole truth.

### Step 4: The Ghost

The ghost is the specific memory or moment that crystallized the wound. It doesn't need to appear in the story, but the writer must know it.

**Ghost Template**:
"When [CHARACTER] was [AGE], [SPECIFIC EVENT] happened. They concluded [FALSE BELIEF], and from then on, they [COPING MECHANISM/MASK]."

Example:
"When Maya was twelve, her father praised her brother's painting and said nothing about hers. She concluded that she would never be good enough, and from then on, she made herself indispensable through service rather than risking creative expression."

---

### Step 5: The Need (Unconscious)

What the character actually requires for wholeness - usually opposite to what they consciously want.

**Common Want/Need Polarities**:
- Wants success / Needs connection
- Wants control / Needs surrender
- Wants revenge / Needs forgiveness
- Wants safety / Needs growth
- Wants approval / Needs self-acceptance
- Wants isolation / Needs community

The story is often the journey from Want to Need.

## Character Dimensions

### The Three Dimensions

1. **Physiology**: Body, appearance, health, mannerisms
2. **Sociology**: Background, class, education, relationships, profession
3. **Psychology**: Fears, desires, beliefs, values, intelligence, temperament

A character needs depth in all three, but can lean into one.

### The Contradiction Principle

The most memorable characters contain contradictions:
- The killer who loves poetry
- The coward who risks everything for a stranger
- The optimist with depression
- The leader who hates being watched

**Contradiction = Complexity = Interest**

## Dialogue Voice

Each character should have a distinct voice. Consider:

**Speech Patterns**:
- Sentence length (short and punchy vs. flowing and elaborate)
- Vocabulary (formal/informal, jargon, regional)
- Rhythm (staccato, musical, hesitant)
- Verbal tics (repeated phrases, filler words)

**Content Patterns**:
- What they talk about (and avoid)
- How they approach conflict
- Their relationship to truth and lies
- What they find funny

**Test**: Cover the name tags. Can you tell who's speaking?

## Character Relationships

Characters exist in relation to others. For each significant relationship:

### The Relationship Diamond

```
       What A wants from B
             ↑
     ┌───────┴───────┐
     │               │
History         Current dynamic
     │               │
     └───────┬───────┘
             ↓
       What B wants from A
```

**Relationship Engines**:
- **Complementary**: Each provides what the other lacks
- **Oppositional**: Fundamental conflict in values/goals
- **Mirror**: Similar wounds, different masks
- **Hierarchical**: Power imbalance (teacher/student, boss/employee)
- **Transformational**: One catalyzes change in the other

## The Antagonist Art

Antagonists are not "bad guys" - they are characters whose goals conflict with the protagonist's.

**The Worthy Antagonist Checklist**:
- [ ] Has their own coherent motivation (not just "evil")
- [ ] Believes they are right
- [ ] Is capable enough to genuinely threaten the protagonist
- [ ] Reflects or contrasts the protagonist thematically
- [ ] Has their own arc (even if off-screen)

**The Mirror Test**: The best antagonists are who the protagonist could become if they made different choices.

## Character Development Arc Types

### Positive Arc (Growth)
Character begins with flaw → Events challenge flaw → Character grows → New equilibrium
*Example: Scrooge (A Christmas Carol)*

### Negative Arc (Fall)
Character begins flawed → Events deepen flaw → Character falls → Tragic end
*Example: Walter White (Breaking Bad)*

### Flat Arc (Testing)
Character begins with truth → World challenges truth → Character maintains truth → Changes world
*Example: Captain America (many MCU films)*

### Transformational Arc (Becoming)
Character's identity fundamentally shifts → They become someone new
*Example: Neville Longbottom (Harry Potter)*

## Quick Character Generation

When you need a character fast:

1. **Pick one wound** from the list above
2. **Choose a mask** that protects it
3. **Define one want** (external goal)
4. **Add one contradiction**
5. **Give them one distinctive physical/verbal trait**

This creates a functional character quickly. Deepen as needed.

## The Life Test

A character is alive when:
- You can predict what they'd order at a restaurant
- You know how they'd react to unexpected news
- They surprise you with choices that feel inevitable in retrospect
- They make decisions you (the writer) disagree with
- They have opinions on things that never appear in the story
