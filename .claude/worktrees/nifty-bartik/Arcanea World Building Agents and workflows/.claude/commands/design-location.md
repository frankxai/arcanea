# Design Location Workflow

This workflow helps you create a detailed, consistent location using the **world-architect** agent.

## Step 1: Location Concept

What type of location are you creating?
- [ ] Realm (continent, planet, plane)
- [ ] Region (country, territory, large area)
- [ ] City or Settlement
- [ ] Village
- [ ] Landmark (specific building, monument, natural feature)

**Location Name**: [Enter name]

**Brief Description**: [1-2 sentences about what makes this location unique]

## Step 2: Geographic Context

**Which world?**: [World name]

**Parent Location** (if applicable): [e.g., region this city is in]

**Climate Type**:
- [ ] Tropical
- [ ] Temperate
- [ ] Arctic/Tundra
- [ ] Arid/Desert
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**Terrain**:
- [ ] Mountains
- [ ] Plains/Grasslands
- [ ] Forest
- [ ] Coastal
- [ ] Desert
- [ ] Swamp/Wetland
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## Step 3: Strategic Purpose

Why does this location matter?
- [ ] Trade hub
- [ ] Military stronghold
- [ ] Religious site
- [ ] Magic nexus
- [ ] Resource-rich area
- [ ] Historical significance
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**Primary Purpose**: [Elaborate]

## Step 4: Agent Coordination

I will now:

1. Use **world-architect** to create detailed geographic description
2. Coordinate with **geography-cartographer** for rich sensory details
3. Calculate travel times to connected locations
4. Link to relevant cultures, characters, and historical events
5. Validate with **lore-master** for consistency
6. Generate location .arc file
7. Update geographic hierarchy and index

The location will be created in: `geography/[realms|regions|locations]/[location-slug].arc`
