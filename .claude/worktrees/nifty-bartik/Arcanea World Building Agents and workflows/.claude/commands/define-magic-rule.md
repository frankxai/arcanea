# Define Magic Rule Workflow

This workflow helps you create or extend your world's magic system using the **magic-systems** agent.

## Step 1: Magic Type

What are you defining?
- [ ] Core Magic System (foundational rules)
- [ ] Magic Category/School
- [ ] Magical Artifact
- [ ] Magical Phenomenon
- [ ] Magic Limitation/Cost
- [ ] Forbidden Magic

**Type**: [Your selection]

**Name**: [Name of magic element]

## Step 2: Core Concept

**Brief Description**: [1-2 sentences describing this magic]

**Primary Effect**: [What does it do?]

**Visual/Sensory Manifestation**: [How does it look/feel/sound?]

## Step 3: Rules & Limitations

**Requirements to Use**:
- [What's needed to access/use this magic?]

**Costs**:
- [What does it consume/require?]

**Limitations**:
- [What CAN'T it do?]

**Side Effects/Consequences**:
- [What are the drawbacks?]

## Step 4: World Integration

**Who can use this?**: [Percentage of population, specific groups, etc]

**Cultural Impact**: [How does this affect society?]

**Historical Context**: [When was it discovered? By whom?]

## Step 5: Balance Check

Rate on scale of 1-10:
**Power Level**: [How potent is this?]
**Accessibility**: [How easy to obtain/learn?]
**Cost/Risk**: [How dangerous/expensive?]

The power should be balanced by accessibility and cost.
High power = Low accessibility OR High cost

## Step 6: Agent Coordination

I will now:

1. Use **magic-systems** to create detailed magic specifications
2. Ensure costs and limitations prevent plot holes
3. Validate against existing magic system in `foundations/magic-system.md`
4. Create artifact or phenomenon .arc file if applicable
5. Update magic system document
6. Check with **lore-master** for consistency
7. Link to affected characters and cultures

The magic will be documented in:
- `foundations/magic-system.md` (for core rules)
- `magic/artifacts/[name].arc` (for artifacts)
- `magic/phenomena/[name].arc` (for phenomena)
