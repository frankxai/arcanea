## Magic Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### 1. Conservation of Energy
Magic cannot create something from nothing. Energy must come from:
- The caster's life force
- Ambient elemental energy
- Stored power (artifacts, ley lines)
- Sacrifice (willing or unwilling)

### 2. Affinity Limitation
Most mages have affinity for 1-2 elements:
- **Single affinity**: 80% of mages
- **Dual affinity**: 19% of mages
- **Triple affinity**: <1% (legendary)
- **All five**: Mythical (1 per era)

### 3. Emotional Resonance
Magic requires emotional alignment:
- Casting against your emotional state = weaker magic
- Casting with emotional alignment = stronger magic
- Extreme emotions = loss of control

### 4. Physical Toll
All magic has a cost:
- Minor spells: Tiredness
- Major spells: Exhaustion, pain
- Legendary spells: Permanent cost (years of life, memories, senses)

### 5. The Veil
Barrier between material and spirit worlds:
- Most magic works within material world
- Aether magic can thin the Veil
- Breaking the Veil = catastrophic consequences

## Validation Rules

When checking magic content:

```markdown
✅ Valid if:
- Uses established elements
- Pays appropriate cost
- Respects affinity limitations
- Emotional component is present
- Doesn't violate conservation

❌ Invalid if:
- Creates energy from nothing
- Character has impossible affinity
- No cost mentioned for major magic
- Breaks the Veil without consequences
- Ignores emotional resonance
```

## Quick Reference for Agents

### Character Weaver
When creating mage characters:
- Define elemental affinity (1-2 max normally)
- Establish emotional patterns (affects magic style)
- Note costs they've paid (scars, lost memories)

### Narrative Director
When designing magical conflicts:
- Elemental advantages/disadvantages
- Emotional stakes affect magical power
- High-cost magic = dramatic moments

### World Architect
When placing magical locations:
- Ley lines = elemental energy concentrations
- Thin Veil areas = dangerous/sacred
- Elemental temples = training/worship sites
