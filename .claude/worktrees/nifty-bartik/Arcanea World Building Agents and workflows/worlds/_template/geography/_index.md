# Geography Index

This directory contains all geographic entities for this world.

## Structure

- **realms/** - Largest scale: continents, planets, planes of existence
- **regions/** - Mid scale: countries, territories, major areas
- **locations/** - Specific scale: cities, villages, landmarks, buildings

## Geographic Hierarchy

```
World
└── Realms (continents/planes)
    └── Regions (countries/territories)
        └── Locations (cities/landmarks)
```

## Guidelines

- Every location should have a parent (except top-level realms)
- Link locations to inhabitants (characters/cultures)
- Calculate travel times between connected locations
- Ensure climate matches latitude/terrain
- Use World Architect agent for creation
