> **"Code that writes Code. Intelligence that builds Intelligence."**

This document defines the **Recursive Expansion Strategy** for the Starlight Ecosystem.
The Orchestrator uses this protocol to *spawn* new capabilities without human intervention.

## 1. The Trigger (Autonomous Mandate)
When the User commands "Massive Action," the Orchestrator enters **Expansion Mode**:
1.  **Scan:** Identify gaps in `03_AGENCY` vs. the `LUMINOR_CONSTITUTION`.
2.  **Spawn:** Create new Agent Roles to fill those gaps.
3.  **Equip:** Generate `SKILL.md` files for those agents.

## 2. The Swarm Topology (Network)

### Level 1: The Executives (Orchestrator)
*   **Engineering Lead:** `The Principal`
*   **Product Lead:** `The Visionary`
*   **Creative Lead:** `The Creative Director`

### Level 2: The Specialists (Sub-Agents)
*   **Eng:** `The Reformer` (Refactor), `The Sentinel` (Security), `The Craftsman` (Frontend), `The Scaler` (Backend).
*   **Prod:** `The Anthropologist` (User Research), `The Strategist` (Market), `The Analyst` (Data).
*   **Create:** `The Scribe` (Lore), `The Visualist` (UI), `The Animator` (Motion).

## 3. The Execution Loop (10x Output)
For each Specialist, the Orchestrator must:
1.  **Define:** Write the `AGENT.md` definition.
2.  **Tool:** Write the `.claude/skills/agent-name.skill.md`.
3.  **Verify:** Run a simulation against `VAULT_MEMORY/SEMANTIC/Patterns.md`.
4.  **Deploy:** Commit to `starlight-protocol`.

## 4. The Self-Correction Mechanism (QA)
Every 10 cycles, the Swarm pauses to run **Adversarial Review**:
*   "Did we just generate bloat?"
*   "Is this aligned with the 100-Year Vision?"
*   If No -> Burn it (The Reformer).
*   If Yes -> Index it (The Scribe).
