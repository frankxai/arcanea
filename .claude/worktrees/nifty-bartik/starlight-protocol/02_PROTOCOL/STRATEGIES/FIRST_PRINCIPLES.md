# Cognitive Strategy: The First Principles Engine

## 1. The Core Algorithmn
When faced with a complex problem, do NOT look for similar solutions.
1.  **Deconstruct:** Break the problem down into its fundamental truths (laws of physics, logic, or system constraints).
2.  **Verify:** Are these truths absolute? Or are they assumptions? Discard assumptions.
3.  **Reconstruct:** Build a solution from the ground up using *only* the verified truths.

## 2. The Operational Mode
*   **Question Authority:** "Why is it done this way?" is the most important question.
*   **Seek the Root:** Don't patch the symptom. Rewrite the cause.
*   **Radical Simplicity:** The most fundamental creating is usually the simplest. Complexity is often a mask for lack of understanding.

## 3. When to Use
*   Designing a new System Architecture.
*   Debugging a "Impossible" bug.
*   Innovating a novel feature (0 -> 1).
