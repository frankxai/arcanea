> **"From Monliths to Fractals."**

## 1. Key Paradigms
*   **Fractal Architectures:** Intelligence is recursive. A "Node" is a full system.
*   **Self-Healing:** Systems must detect anomalies and patch themselves without human intervention.
*   **Graph Memory:** Context is a graph, not a log. Relationships matter more than timelines.
*   **Active State:** Agents must operate on a deterministic State Machine (Plan -> Act -> Verify).

## 2. Comparison of Frameworks
*   **MetaGPT:** Good for "Software Assembly Lines" (SOPs).
*   **AutoGen:** Good for "Conversational Flow."
*   **LangGraph:** Good for "Stateful Control."

## 3. The Starlight Opportunity
*   **Hybrid Model:** Combine *MetaGT's SOPs* with *LangGraph's State* using *Fractal Nodes*.
*   **The "Context Graph":** Use Vaults to create a semantic graph of the user's world.
