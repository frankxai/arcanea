# Intimate Verses

## The Quiet Freedoms

# I. Body

## Permission to Breathe

Today I gave myself permission
to breathe
all the way in.

Not the shallow breath
of someone waiting
for the next blow.

The full breath.
The one that fills
every corner.

It has been years
since I breathed
like this.

---

## The Body Remembers

My shoulders remember
hunching against disappointment.

My jaw remembers
clenching against words
I was not allowed to say.

My stomach remembers
swallowing what I really felt
so no one would be upset.

Now I am teaching my body
to forget
what it learned
when forgetting was survival.

---

## Held

There is a way of being held
that has nothing to do
with arms.

It is the way the earth
holds the tree.
The way the sky
holds the bird.
The way the breath
holds the body.

I am learning
to feel held
like that.
By what?
By everything.

---

## Tears

I used to apologize
for crying.

Now I understand:
these waters
were stored too long.
They need to flow.

Apologizing for tears
is like apologizing
for rain.

---

# II. Voice

## What I Swallowed

I swallowed so many words
they built a city in my chest.

Now I am learning
to speak them,
one by one,
letting the city empty
onto the page
into the air
into the space
where they always belonged.

---

## The First No

The first no
I ever said
and meant—

I was thirty-four.

It came out shaking.
It came out small.
But it came out.

And the world
did not end.

That was the day
I learned:
I have a voice.
It has power.
I am allowed to use it.

---

## Singing

When I was small,
someone told me
I couldn't sing.

I believed them.
For twenty years.

Now I sing anyway.
Off-key.
Full-hearted.
Free.

The point was never
to sing well.
The point was never
to stop.

---

## The Unsaid

There is a graveyard
of words I never said.

I visit sometimes.
I mourn the conversations
I was too afraid to have.

But I do not live there.
I live in the sentences
I am finally speaking now.

---

# III. Heart

## The Opening

My heart was a fist
for so long
I forgot
it was ever a hand.

Now it is learning
to unfold.
Finger by finger.
Slowly.
It takes time.

Soon it will be open.
Soon it will be ready
to hold
what it was always meant
to hold.

---

## What Love Taught Me

Love taught me
I was wrong about everything.

I was wrong about walls.
They don't protect—they imprison.

I was wrong about risk.
The risk is not in opening—
the risk is in staying closed.

I was wrong about pain.
It is not the enemy of love—
it is the proof of love.

Love taught me
I knew nothing.
This was the kindest lesson.

---

## Forgiveness

Forgiveness is not
saying it was okay.
It was not okay.

Forgiveness is
putting down the weight.
Saying: I will not carry this anymore.
Saying: You no longer get to live
in my body
rent-free.

Forgiveness is not for them.
It is for me.
It is my freedom.
I give it to myself.

---

## The Heart After Healing

The heart after healing
is not the heart before wounding.

It is not "as good as new."
It is better.

It is a heart that knows
what it can survive.
It is a heart that broke
and chose to open anyway.

That is not the same heart.
That is a stronger heart.
That is a wiser heart.
That is a free heart.

---

# IV. Self

## The Stranger in the Mirror

For years,
the face in the mirror
was someone else.
Someone I was supposed to be.
Someone I was told I was.

One morning I looked
and saw myself.
Really saw.
For the first time.

I wept.
Not from sadness.
From recognition.

"There you are," I said.
"I've been looking everywhere."

---

## Enough

I am enough.

Not because I achieved.
Not because I earned.
Not because I proved.

I am enough
because I exist.
That is all.
That is everything.

The addition was always extra.
The core was always complete.

---

## What I Am Not

I am not my failures.
I am the one who failed and continued.

I am not my fears.
I am the one who feared and acted anyway.

I am not my wounds.
I am the one who was wounded and healed.

I am not the story they told about me.
I am the author of my own story now.

---

## The Return to Self

I did not find myself
in a special place.

I found myself
in the ordinary moment
when I stopped looking
and started listening.

Myself was here all along.
Waiting.
Patient.
Never gone.

"Welcome back," myself said.
"I never left."

---

# V. Time

## Now

The past is a story
I tell myself.
The future is a story
I imagine.

Only now is real.
Only now is free.
Only now is actually happening.

I practice staying here.
It is harder than it sounds.
And more liberating
than I ever imagined.

---

## What I Would Tell My Younger Self

It gets better.
I know you can't believe that.
I know everything feels permanent.
It is not.

You will survive this.
You will survive more than this.
One day you will look back
and be amazed
at what you carried.

But also:
don't just survive.
Live.
Right now.
Even in the dark.
The dark is not a waiting room
for the light.
The dark is life too.
Live it.

---

## The Present Moment

This moment
is the only moment
you have ever had.

All other moments
are memory or imagination.

This moment is it.
This is your whole life.
Everything happens here.

How will you spend it?
Waiting for something else?
Or living?

---

## Time Enough

There is time enough
for everything that matters.

There is not time
for everything that doesn't.

This is not scarcity.
This is gift.
The constraint forces choice.
Choice forces clarity.
Clarity is freedom.

---

# VI. Silence

## The Space Between

In the space between
one breath and the next—
freedom.

In the silence between
one thought and the next—
peace.

We overlook these spaces.
We rush through them
on our way to something.

But the spaces are not empty.
The spaces are where
everything important lives.

---

## What Silence Taught Me

Silence taught me
I am afraid of myself.

In noise, I can hide.
In activity, I can forget.
In silence, I am here.
Alone.
With myself.

At first, terrifying.
Then, liberating.
There is nothing in myself
I cannot face.
There is nothing in myself
I need to hide from.

I am safe
in my own company.
This is freedom.

---

## The Quiet Revolution

The loud revolutions
get the attention.
The flags. The speeches. The crowds.

The quiet revolutions
get the results.
The daily discipline.
The small choice, repeated.
The patient work of becoming
who you actually are.

My revolution is quiet.
No one notices.
But I am changing.
Day by day.
Breath by breath.
Free.

---

## After All the Noise

After all the noise,
after all the words,
after all the doing—

just this:

Silence.
Presence.
Breath.
Being.

Nothing to prove.
Nothing to become.
Nowhere to go.
Already here.
Already whole.
Already free.

---

# VII. Final Words

## To You

You, reading this—
do you know?

You are not alone.
The cage you feel
is not real.
The weight you carry
can be put down.

I know you may not believe me.
I didn't believe either.
For a long time.

But I walked the path.
And I am writing to you
from the other side.

It is real.
Freedom is real.
And you can have it.

Not someday.
Now.

---

## The Last Verse

I began in chains.
I am ending in wings.

Not because I am special.
Because I am ordinary.
And what is possible for the ordinary
is possible for you.

Fly.
