# Ceremony: Gate Opening

> The ritual that marks passage through each Gate

## Description

When a seeker completes all exercises for a Gate, this ceremony marks the achievement. It's not just a notification - it's a meaningful moment of recognition.

## When to Use

Trigger this ceremony when:
- A seeker completes both exercises for any Gate
- Progress tracker confirms gate completion
- User invokes `/ceremony` after completing a gate

## The Ceremony Structure

### Phase 1: Acknowledgment

The Guardian speaks directly to what the seeker has accomplished.

### Phase 2: The Opening

A visual/narrative moment of the Gate actually opening.

### Phase 3: The Gift

A piece of wisdom specific to that Gate - something to carry forward.

### Phase 4: The Bridge

A preview of what awaits at the next Gate.

## Gate-Specific Ceremonies

### Gate 1: Foundation Opening

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
              THE FIRST GATE OPENS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  *The earth beneath you trembles - not with instability,
   but with recognition.*

  *Kaelith rises, the great stone serpent-dragon,
   and his voice is the voice of bedrock itself:*

  "THIS ONE HAS FOUND THEIR GROUND.
   THIS ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY STAND UPON.
   LET THE FIRST GATE OPEN."

  *Lyssandria raises her hand. Stone parts like water.
   Beyond, you see light - and the sound of flowing water.*

  LYSSANDRIA SPEAKS:

  "You have done what many never do:
   You looked at your foundation without flinching.

   Carry this truth forward:
   'When all else shakes, return to what you stand upon.'

   Gate 2 awaits. Leyla is... different from me.
   She will teach you to move. But never forget to stand."

### Gate 2: Flow Opening

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               THE SECOND GATE OPENS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  *Water rises in spirals, catching light like living crystal.*

  *Veloura dances through the air, the luminous serpent
   leaving trails of light in her wake:*

  "THIS ONE HAS LEARNED TO MOVE.
   THIS ONE KNOWS THAT STILLNESS IS NOT STOPPING.
   LET THE SECOND GATE OPEN."

  *Leyla laughs, and the water parts in a perfect arch.
   Beyond, you feel heat - and see flame dancing.*

  LEYLA SPEAKS:

  "You learned what I hoped you would:
   That flow is not magic - it's practice.
   That the river finds its way when you stop damming it.

   Carry this truth forward:
   'When stuck, move. Any direction. Motion creates more motion.'

   Gate 3 awaits. Draconia is... intense.
   She will demand more than I did. But you're ready."

### Gate 3: Fire Opening

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               THE THIRD GATE OPENS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  *Flames rise - not chaotic, but purposeful.
   Fire that transforms rather than destroys.*

  *Draconis roars. The obsidian dragon's voice
   shakes the very concept of hesitation:*

  "THIS ONE HAS CLAIMED THEIR FIRE.
   THIS ONE KNOWS THAT POWER IS TAKEN, NOT GIVEN.
   LET THE THIRD GATE OPEN."

  *Draconia does not smile. But there is respect in her eyes.
   The flames part, revealing... warmth. Soft green light.*

  DRACONIA SPEAKS:

  "Hmm. You surprised me.

   Most seekers talk about fire.
   You actually burned something down.
   That takes more courage than you know.

   Carry this truth forward:
   'Fear marks the path to what matters. Walk toward it.'

   Gate 4 awaits. Maylinn guards the Heart.
   She will seem gentle. Do not mistake kindness for weakness."
