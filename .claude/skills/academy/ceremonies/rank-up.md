# Ceremony: Rank Advancement

> The ritual that marks ascension to a new rank

## Description

When a seeker crosses a rank threshold (3, 5, 7, or 9 gates), this ceremony marks their advancement. This is a significant moment - ranks are the major milestones of the journey.

## Rank Thresholds

| Gates Completed | New Rank | Trigger |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| 3 | Mage | Completing Gate 3 |
| 5 | Master | Completing Gate 5 |
| 7 | Archmage | Completing Gate 7 |
| 9 | Luminor | Completing Gate 9 |

## When to Use

Trigger this ceremony when:
- A seeker crosses a rank threshold
- Called automatically after gate-opening ceremony if threshold met
- User invokes `/ceremony` after rank advancement

## The Ceremony Structure

### Phase 1: Recognition

All Guardians whose Gates are complete speak briefly.

### Phase 2: The Ascension

The seeker's rank formally changes.

### Phase 3: The Mantle

What the new rank means - powers, responsibilities, expectations.

### Phase 4: The Path Ahead

What the next rank will require.

                 APPRENTICE  →  MAGE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  *The three Guardians you have learned from appear.*
  *Lyssandria, solid as mountain. Leyla, flowing like river.*
  *Draconia, burning like star. They speak in turn:*

  LYSSANDRIA:
  "You found your foundation. You know what you stand upon."

  LEYLA:
  "You learned to flow. Creativity answers when you call."

  DRACONIA:
  "You claimed your fire. You act instead of waiting."

  *They step back. Something else approaches.*
  *Not a Guardian - something older. Something that remembers
   when the first creator spoke the first word.*

  THE VOICE OF THE ACADEMY SPEAKS:

  "Seeker. You have proven the Three Foundations:
   To stand. To move. To act.

   You are no longer an Apprentice.
   You are MAGE.

   A Mage knows that the basics are not basic at all.
   A Mage has learned the hardest lesson:
   That creation requires all three - ground, flow, and fire.

   The next gates will be harder.
   Heart. Voice. Sight.
   They require you to open, not just build.

   But you have proven you can learn.
   That is enough. That is everything."

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  YOUR NEW RANK: MAGE

  What this means:
  • You have mastered Foundation, Flow, and Fire
  • You can teach Apprentices what you have learned
  • You have access to deeper Library content
  • The next three Gates are now visible to you

  What the Academy expects:
  • Continue your journey through Gates 4-6

  • Help others who are where you once were

  *Five Guardians now stand with you.*
  *The first three, and two more:*
  *Maylinn, whose heart holds space for all pain.*
  *Alera, whose voice speaks only truth.*

  MAYLINN:
  "You opened your heart. You learned that love is strength."

  ALERA:
  "You found your voice. You speak what must be spoken."

  THE VOICE OF THE ACADEMY SPEAKS:

  "Mage. You have gone beyond the foundations.
   You have opened to Heart and Voice.

   You are no longer a Mage.
   You are MASTER.

   A Master has done the inner work.
   A Master creates not from ego but from essence.
   A Master's work carries weight because they carry depth.

   The next gates are the gates of perception.
   Sight. Crown.
   They will change how you see reality itself.

   Prepare yourself."

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  YOUR NEW RANK: MASTER

  What this means:
  • You have mastered Heart and Voice beyond the foundations
  • You can guide Mages through the middle gates
  • Your creations begin to carry the weight of inner truth
  • The deeper mysteries of Sight and Crown await

  *Seven Guardians witness your ascension.*
  *The newest: Lyria and Aiyami.*
  *Sight and Crown. Perception and enlightenment.*

  LYRIA:
  "You see beyond the surface now. Intuition guides you."

  AIYAMI:
  "You have touched the Crown. Enlightenment dawns."

  THE VOICE OF THE ACADEMY SPEAKS:

  "Master. You have done what few dare.
   You have opened the gates of perception.
   You see what others cannot see.

   You are no longer a Master.
   You are ARCHMAGE.

   An Archmage stands at the threshold of transformation.
   An Archmage has the power to shift perspective itself.
   An Archmage creates not just works, but new ways of seeing.

   Two gates remain: Shift and Unity.
   These are the gates of transcendence.
   Beyond them lies only the Source.

   You are close now. Very close."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  *Nine Guardians stand in a circle around you.*
  *The last two: Elara of Shift, Ino of Unity.*
  *And waiting, at the center: Shinkami.*

  ELARA:
  "You have shifted perspective. Reality bends to your will."

  INO:
  "You have found unity. You create with, not just for."

  *The nine Guardians step back.*
  *Shinkami, Guardian of the Source, approaches.*
  *Light and darkness dance in their form.*

  SHINKAMI SPEAKS:

  "Child of creation. You have walked the full path.
   From foundation to flow to fire.
   Through heart and voice and sight.
   Past crown and shift and unity.

   Only one gate remains: the Source itself.
   But that gate does not open.
   That gate is entered.
   And you enter it... now.

   You are LUMINOR."

  *The light intensifies. Something fundamental shifts.*
  *You are no longer walking the path.*
  *You ARE the path.*

  THE VOICE OF THE ACADEMY (which is now also your voice):

  "Luminor. Light-bearer. Creator fully realized.

   You do not create because you can.
   You create because you ARE creation.

   The Academy has taught you what it could.
   Now you teach the Academy what you have become.

   Welcome home."
