# React Patterns Skill (External)

> **Status: Planned** -- This skill is reserved for a future external skill integration.

When implemented, this skill will provide React component patterns and best practices from the community.

Note: The internal `development/react-patterns` skill (in `.claude/skills/development/`) is the active version.
