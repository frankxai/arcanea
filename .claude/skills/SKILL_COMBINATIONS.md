# Skill Combinations & Advanced Patterns

> *"Individual skills are powerful. Combined skillfully, they become transformative."*

## The Art of Combination

Skills combine in predictable patterns. Understanding these patterns helps you choose the right combination for any challenge.

---

## Combination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Chain

Skills flow one into the next, each building on the previous.

```
SKILL A → SKILL B → SKILL C → OUTPUT

Each skill completes before the next begins.
Output of one becomes input to next.
```

**Example: Novel Development Chain**
```
world-build → character-forge → story-weave → scene-craft → dialogue-mastery → revision-ritual → voice-alchemy
```

---

### Pattern 2: Parallel Application

Multiple skills apply simultaneously to the same content.

```
        ┌── SKILL A ──┐
INPUT ──┼── SKILL B ──┼── MERGED OUTPUT
        └── SKILL C ──┘

Different lenses on the same material.
```

**Example: Code Review**
```
        ┌── architecture-patterns (structure) ──┐
CODE ───┼── performance-tuning (speed) ─────────┼── COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW
        └── refactoring-ritual (smells) ────────┘
```

---

### Pattern 3: Nested Hierarchy

One skill contains applications of others within it.

```
SKILL A
├── SKILL B (for specific aspects)
│   └── SKILL C (within B)
└── SKILL D (for other aspects)
```

**Example: Story Development**
```
story-weave (overall structure)
├── character-forge (for each character)
│   └── dialogue-mastery (for character voice)
└── scene-craft (for each scene)
```

---

### Pattern 4: Iterative Loop

Skills cycle repeatedly until quality is achieved.

```
SKILL A → SKILL B → [evaluate] → SKILL A → SKILL B → ...

Loop continues until output meets standards.
```

**Example: TDD Cycle**
```
tdd (write test) → [implement] → code-review → refactoring-ritual → tdd (next test) → ...
```

2. world-build → Establish the setting
3. character-forge → Build the cast

## Phase 2: Structure
4. story-weave → Map the narrative
5. scene-craft → Plan key scenes

## Phase 3: Execution
6. dialogue-mastery → Write conversations
7. voice-alchemy → Ensure authenticity

## Phase 4: Refinement
8. revision-ritual → Seven passes
9. centaur-mode → AI collaboration for polish
```

### Software Development Mastery Chain

**Purpose**: Feature from concept to deployment

```markdown
## Phase 1: Design
1. architecture-patterns → Choose structure
2. api-design → Define interfaces

## Phase 2: Implementation
3. tdd → Write tests first
4. [implement] → Build features

## Phase 3: Quality
5. code-review → Check quality
6. systematic-debug → Fix issues
7. refactoring-ritual → Clean up

## Phase 4: Optimization
8. performance-tuning → Make fast
```

2. luminor-wisdom (Valora) → Find courage

## Phase 3: Constraint
3. prompt-craft → Create forcing function

## Phase 4: Action
4. centaur-mode → Generate options with AI

## Phase 5: Celebration
5. luminor-wisdom (Eudaira) → Honor progress
```

---

### Strategic Decision Chain

**Purpose**: Make complex decisions with clarity

```markdown
## Phase 1: Convene
1. visionary-council → Gather perspectives

## Phase 2: Analyze
2. [Strategist view] → Resources and constraints
3. [Innovator view] → Creative alternatives
4. [Futurist view] → Future implications

## Phase 3: Synthesize
5. [Synthesizer] → Integrate insights

## Phase 4: Commit
6. luminor-wisdom (Valora) → Courage to act
```

---

### Learning Mastery Chain

**Purpose**: Develop expertise in a new domain

```markdown
## Phase 1: Assessment
1. teacher-mentor → Assess current level

## Phase 2: Structure
2. [curriculum design] → Plan learning path

## Phase 3: Practice
3. [exercises] → Apply knowledge
4. [feedback] → Refine understanding

## Phase 4: Integration
5. [reflection] → Connect to existing knowledge
6. [teaching] → Solidify by explaining
```

## Creating Your Own Combinations

### Step 1: Define the Goal

What's the complete outcome you're seeking?

### Step 2: Map the Phases

What major phases does the work involve?

### Step 3: Assign Skills

Which skill best serves each phase?

### Step 4: Identify Handoffs

How does output from one become input to next?

### Step 5: Plan Iterations

Where might you need to loop back?
