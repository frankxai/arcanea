- Make it empowering (they created something real)
- Make it social (community matters)
- Make it clear (no confusion about next steps)

**Never:**
- Overwhelming complexity in first session
- Dark or discouraging themes
- Competitive pressure
- Judgment of creative choices
- Forced social interaction

*This onboarding narrative creates the foundation for a creator's entire Arcanean journey. Every word, every moment, every choice shapes how they see themselves and the platform. Make it magical.*
