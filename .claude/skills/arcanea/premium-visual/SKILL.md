# Premium Visual Intelligence v2.0 — Information-Dense Glassmorphism

> *"Every pixel carries information. Every surface is glass. Intelligence is beautiful."*

## Purpose

Produces **world-class visual infographics** that combine the information density of a Bloomberg terminal with the material quality of luxury 3D rendering. This is NOT empty art. This is NOT busy HUD. This is **data made beautiful through glass, crystal, and light**.

## The Premium Infographic Standard

Think: **Apple Keynote data slides meets luxury annual report meets 3D glass rendering.**

### Core Principle: INFORMATION + MATERIALS

Every visual MUST satisfy BOTH criteria:
1. **Information-Dense** — Contains real data, labels, structure, hierarchy, numbers, relationships
2. **Premium Materials** — Rendered in 3D glass, crystal, frosted surfaces, volumetric light

### 10 Commandments

1. **Every element communicates data** — No decorative filler. If it doesn't inform, remove it
2. **Glass panels for structure** — Information organized on frosted/translucent glass cards
3. **3D depth creates hierarchy** — Foreground = primary, midground = secondary, background = ambient
4. **Labels are mandatory** — Clean, modern sans-serif labels on every significant element
5. **2-3 accent colors maximum** — Teal (#7fffd4) + Gold (#ffd700) + Violet (#9966ff) on void (#0b0e14)
6. **Dramatic directional lighting** — Single key light creating rim glow on glass surfaces
7. **Connections show relationships** — Luminous threads between related glass nodes
8. **Numbers add credibility** — Stats, counts, frequencies, percentages wherever relevant
9. **Typography hierarchy** — Title (large, light), subtitles (medium, teal), body (small, white)
10. **Breathing room between data** — Dense ≠ cluttered. Use glass panel spacing for visual parsing

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER)

- Empty minimal art with one floating object (too simple, says nothing)
- Cyberpunk HUD with scan lines and neon overlays (tacky)
- Claymorphism or plastic textures (cheap)
- Flat 2D diagrams or flowcharts (boring)
- Busy starfield backgrounds (distracting)
- Stock photo compositions (generic)
- Text-heavy poster layouts without 3D elements (infographic slop)

## Visual DNA

### Color Palette (Strict)
```
VOID:      #0b0e14  (Background — infinite dark)
CRYSTAL:   #7fffd4  (Primary accent — teal glass glow)
GOLD:      #ffd700  (Secondary accent — warm highlights)
VIOLET:    #9966ff  (Tertiary — depth and mystery)
TEXT:      #e6eefc  (Primary text — cool white)
MUTED:     #8892a8  (Secondary text — subdued)
```

### Material Language
- **Frosted Glass Panels** — Semi-transparent cards holding text/data, subtle blur
- **Crystal Nodes** — 3D translucent spheres/polyhedra representing key concepts
- **Glass Connectors** — Thin luminous lines showing relationships
- **Volumetric Light** — Teal/gold rim lighting on glass edges
- **Depth Fog** — Subtle atmospheric perspective separating layers
- **Metallic Accents** — Brushed titanium frames on glass panels

## Prompt Architecture

### Template: Information-Dense Glass Infographic
```
[TOPIC] infographic rendered as premium 3D glassmorphic visualization.
Dark void background (#0b0e14). Multiple frosted glass panels floating at
different depths, each containing [SPECIFIC DATA POINTS].
[NUMBER] translucent crystal nodes representing [CONCEPTS], connected by
thin luminous teal threads. Each node labeled with clean white sans-serif
text. Dramatic spotlight from upper-left creating teal (#7fffd4) rim
lighting on glass edges. Gold (#ffd700) accents on [KEY HIGHLIGHTS].
Title "[TITLE TEXT]" in elegant thin modern typeface at top.
Statistics and numbers visible on glass surfaces. Professional data
visualization meets luxury 3D rendering. 16:9 wide composition.
Ultra-high detail, studio quality. NOT flat, NOT HUD, NOT clay.
```

### Template: Hero Banner with Data
```
Wide 16:9 hero composition. Central luminous [SYMBOL] made of translucent
crystal, surrounded by orbital data elements on frosted glass cards.
Each card shows key stat: "[STAT1]", "[STAT2]", "[STAT3]".
Connected by thin glass threads forming constellation pattern.
Deep void background with subtle teal atmospheric gradient.
Title "[BRAND]" in ultra-thin modern serif with generous tracking.
Tagline "[TAGLINE]" in muted smaller text below.
Dramatic volumetric lighting. Premium tech-luxury aesthetic.
```

### Template: System Architecture
```
Technical architecture diagram rendered as 3D glass layer visualization.
[N] horizontal frosted glass platforms stacked with depth separation,
each representing an architectural layer. Layer labels in clean white
text: "[LAYER1]", "[LAYER2]", "[LAYER3]". Within each layer, small
crystal nodes for components, connected by luminous teal threads.
Vertical golden light beams connecting layers. Dark void background.
Professional technical illustration meets luxury rendering.
Isometric-ish angle showing depth. Title "[TITLE]" at top.
```

## Model Selection
1. **gemini-3-pro-image-preview** via nano-banana — Best quality, uses thinking tokens
2. **gemini-2.5-flash-image** via nano-banana — Fast iteration for drafts
3. **NEVER infogenius for final visuals** — Adds unwanted annotations

## Research-First Pipeline (ACOS Pattern)

```
1. RESEARCH    → Use infogenius research_topic for real facts
2. STRUCTURE   → Organize facts into visual hierarchy
3. COMPOSE     → Craft prompt encoding facts into glass materials
4. GENERATE    → nano-banana gemini-3-pro-image-preview
5. EVALUATE    → Does it inform AND attract? Both required.
```

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Contains at least 5 distinct data points or concepts?
- [ ] Every element is labeled or identifiable?
- [ ] Uses 3D glass/crystal materials (not flat, not clay)?
- [ ] Has clear visual hierarchy (foreground/mid/background)?
- [ ] Maximum 3 accent colors?
- [ ] Would this work in a pitch deck for a $1B company?
- [ ] Does someone learn something by looking at it?
- [ ] Is there dramatic directional lighting?
