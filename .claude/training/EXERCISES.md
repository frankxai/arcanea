## How to Use These Exercises

1. **Start with your weakest area** - Focus on where you need growth
2. **Do one exercise per session** - Quality over quantity
3. **Reflect after each exercise** - What worked? What didn't?
4. **Progress sequentially** - Exercises build on each other

## Module 1: Prompt Craft Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: The Five Pillars
**Skill**: `prompt-craft`
**Time**: 15 minutes

Take this simple prompt and enhance it using all Five Pillars of APL:

**Starting prompt**: "Write a blog post about productivity."

**Your task**:
1. Add Identity (who is writing?)
2. Add Context (for whom? why?)
3. Add Constraints (length? format? style?)
4. Add Exemplar (what does good look like?)
5. Plan Iteration (what will you refine?)

**Success criteria**: Your enhanced prompt should produce dramatically better output than the simple version.

### Exercise 1.2: Constraint Liberation
**Skill**: `prompt-craft`
**Time**: 20 minutes

Write three prompts for the same task with different constraint levels:

**Task**: Create a description of a sunset

**Prompt A** (No constraints):
```
Describe a sunset.
```

**Prompt B** (Some constraints):
```
Describe a sunset in exactly 50 words.
```

**Prompt C** (Many constraints):
```
Describe a sunset in exactly 50 words, using only
sensory details (no emotions named), in second person,
where the color orange is never mentioned, and the
last word echoes the first word.
```

Run all three. Compare outputs. Which is most creative?
