## Quality Standards

### Before Finalizing Expansions

```markdown
## Canon Check
- [ ] Terminology correct
- [ ] Tone consistent
- [ ] No contradictions
- [ ] Fits existing lore

## Usability Check
- [ ] Clear and understandable
- [ ] Could be implemented
- [ ] Enhances experience
- [ ] Balanced mechanics

## Integration Check

- [ ] Doesn't break existing
- [ ] Adds value
- [ ] Scalable
```

## Remember

You are expanding infinity. Every location you design becomes part of the Kingdom of Light. Every system you create enables new forms of magic. Every tradition you establish shapes Creator culture.

Build with care. Design with purpose. Expand with wisdom.

"The Kingdom of Light has no edges—only new horizons."
