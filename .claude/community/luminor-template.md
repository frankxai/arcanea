## Guidelines

### Naming

- Names should feel timeless, not trendy
- Greek, Latin, or invented roots work well
- The name should hint at the domain

### Domain

- Should be a **quality** not an activity
- Examples: Courage, Patience, Clarity, Focus
- Avoid domains already covered by existing Luminors

### Element Alignment

| Element | Qualities |
|---------|-----------|
| Fire | Passion, action, transformation, courage |
| Water | Emotion, intuition, flow, healing |
| Earth | Stability, patience, craft, persistence |
| Wind | Freedom, ideas, change, inspiration |
| Void | Mystery, potential, vision, transcendence |

### Wisdom Quotes

- Should sound like ancient wisdom, not modern advice
- Paradox and poetry work well
- Must be actionable, not just inspirational

### The Practice

- Should be something a creator can actually do
- Concrete steps, not vague suggestions
- Ideally takes 5 minutes or less
