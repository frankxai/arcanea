## Guidelines

### Naming

- Name should be evocative and memorable
- Fantasy creature types work well (Wyrm, Shade, Specter, Demon)
- Name should hint at the block's nature

### Danger Level

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Low | Annoying but manageable |
| Medium | Can derail a project if ignored |
| High | Can stop creative work entirely |
| Critical | Can end creative practice long-term |

### Category

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Initiation | Prevents beginning |
| Continuation | Prevents progress |
| Completion | Prevents finishing |
| Sustainability | Prevents long-term practice |

### The Creature's Lies

- These should be thoughts the creator actually has
- Written in first person from the creator's perspective
- Should feel uncomfortably familiar

### Weakness

- Must be specific and actionable
- Not generic advice ("try harder")
- Based on real experience of overcoming this block

- **The Shiny Object Siren** - Lures you away to new projects

- **The Audience Phantom** - Imaginary critics watching your work
- **The Sunk Cost Golem** - Can't abandon bad work because of investment
