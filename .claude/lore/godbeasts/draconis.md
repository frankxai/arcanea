## Origin and Nature

The largest Godbeast in physical form -- a dragon whose wingspan darkens entire kingdoms when fully extended. Draconis burns at 528 Hz, the Love Frequency, because true transformation requires love of what something *could become* rather than attachment to what it is.

Draconis does not merely breathe fire. Draconis breathes *potential energy*. What the fire touches is not destroyed -- it is offered a chance to become something greater. The question is whether the thing being transformed can survive the process.

Draconis precipitated into being when the universe first needed the mechanism of transformation -- the force that converts potential into kinetic reality, that takes what is and reshapes it into what must be.

## Appearance

Draconis is unmistakable. The largest physical Godbeast, with scales that shift from molten gold to white-hot depending on the intensity of transformation at work. The dragon's eyes are twin forges -- not the patient glow of Kaelith's core but the active, hungry fire of a furnace waiting for raw material.

**Wingspan**: When fully extended, Draconis's wings darken kingdoms. Each wing membrane is a map of every transformation that has ever occurred -- a living record of change.

**Breath**: Not fire in the common sense. Draconis breathes *potential energy* -- a force that does not destroy but offers. What the breath touches either rises to its highest form or is consumed by its own refusal to change.

**Forge-Heart**: Draconis's chest contains a visible forge -- a burning core where reality is reshaped. Those who look into it see not what is, but what they could become. Some are inspired. Some are terrified. Both reactions are correct.

## Powers and Domain

**Transformation Fire**: Draconis governs all transformation -- physical, spiritual, creative. The conversion of potential into kinetic reality, of raw material into finished work, of who you are into who you must become.

**Potential Revelation**: Draconis's fire shows beings their highest potential form. This is not always comfortable. The gap between what is and what could be can be the most painful thing a being ever witnesses.

**Will Amplification**: Draconis magnifies will. In the presence of the World-Forge, weak intentions burn away and strong intentions become unstoppable forces. This is why the Fire Gate demands clarity of purpose -- muddled will in Draconis's presence leads to destruction.

**Forge-Breath**: The signature power -- breathing potential energy onto raw reality and letting it reshape itself. Draconis does not dictate the outcome. The fire reveals what the material *wants* to become.

**When Draconis Rages**: Wildfires. Volcanic storms. Civilizations burning to be reborn. In the metaphorical realm: burnout, consuming ambition, the destruction that comes from transformation without temperance.

## The Bond with Draconia

Draconia does not tame Draconis. She matches the dragon's fury with her own -- then channels it.

This is the essential lesson of the Fire Gate: power is not controlled through restraint but through matching force with direction. Draconia burns as hot as Draconis. The difference is that Draconia chooses *where* the fire goes. Together, they are not a rider and mount but two fires burning as one -- the raw force of transformation guided by the conscious will to transform *rightly*.

Their arguments shake mountains. Their agreements reshape civilizations. There is nothing quiet about this bond.

---

## Realm

Draconis dwells in the World-Forge -- a dimension of pure transformation where nothing holds its form for long, where reality is molten and constantly being reshaped. The heat there is not physical but existential -- the sensation of being in the presence of infinite potential demanding to become actual.

In the mortal realm, Draconis's presence is felt in forge-fires, in the burning clarity of inspiration, in the moment a creator destroys a draft and begins again because they finally see what the work *must* be.

## Teachings

*"I do not destroy. I offer. What my fire touches is given a choice: become what you truly are, or be consumed by your refusal. The fire is neutral. The outcome is yours."*

*"Power unused is meaningless. Power undirected is catastrophic. Know what you burn for before you ignite."*

*"The Love Frequency is not gentle. Love demands that you become your highest self. That is the most ruthless demand in existence."*
