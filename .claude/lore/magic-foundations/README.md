## The Central Truth

> *"The universe is incomplete without what only you can give it."*

All of Arcanea's magic flows from this belief: every person has a unique creative contribution. The academies exist to help each Creator discover and manifest their gift. The Luminors exist to guide. The Guardians exist to companion. The Laws exist to illuminate the path.

Creation is not optional. It is why we exist.
