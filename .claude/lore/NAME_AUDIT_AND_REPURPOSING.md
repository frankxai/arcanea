# Arcanea Name Audit & Repurposing

## Purpose

This document tracks names that conflict with canonical definitions and proposes either corrections or repurposing opportunities. The name "Aethon" was discovered in use but is not among the canonical Ten Godbeasts.

---

## Names Requiring Correction

### 1. **AETHON** (Godbeast Reference)

**Location:** `book/creator-principles/chapters/01-partnership-principle.md` (line 60)

**Current Usage:**
> "The Architect Maylinn designed the Crystal Spires alone for forty years... When she partnered with the Godbeast Aethon, whose vision could see structural harmonics invisible to mortal eyes..."

**Problem:** Aethon is NOT a canonical Godbeast. The Ten Canonical Godbeasts are:
1. Kaelith (Root - stone serpent-dragon)
2. Veloura (Sacral - sea serpent with flame fins)
3. Draconis (Solar - lion-dragon)
4. Laeylinn (Heart - glowing stag)
5. Otome (Throat - cosmic whale)
6. Yumiko (Third Eye - owl-serpent)
7. Sol (Crown - radiant light dragon)
8. Vaelith (Bridge - eight-tailed fox)
9. *Unnamed* (Unity - tiger-dragon fusion)
10. *Fused with Shinkami* (Source)

**Recommended Fix:** Replace "Godbeast Aethon" with a canonical Godbeast. Since the text mentions "structural harmonics," consider:
- **Sol** (Crown) - radiant dragon of crystallized light could perceive harmonic structures
- **Yumiko** (Third Eye) - owl-serpent with vision/perception domain
- **Kaelith** (Root) - stone serpent-dragon with earth/architecture domain

---

### 2. **MAYLINN** (Name Collision)

**Location:** Same passage in `01-partnership-principle.md` (line 60)

**Current Usage:** "The Architect Maylinn"

**Problem:** Maylinn is canonically the **Guardian of the Heart Gate** (Fourth Gate, 417 Hz), partnered with Godbeast Laeylinn. Using the same name for a historical architect creates confusion.

**Recommended Fix:** Rename the architect character. Suggestions:
- **Architect Seraphine** (evokes celestial design)
- **Architect Caelindra** (sounds Eldrian, means "sky builder")
- **Architect Onyxia** (for obsidian/crystal work)
- **Architect Theralind** (sounds scholarly, Eldrian)
- **Architect Valorine** (evokes structure and value)

---

### 3. **INO & KYURO** (Inconsistent Classification) — RESOLVED

**Problem:** Documentation was inconsistent about whether both are Guardians or if Ino is the Guardian and Kyuro is the Godbeast.

**Canon:** Ino = Guardian, Kyuro = Godbeast (Tiger-Dragon)

**Resolution:** All files have been updated to show:
- **Guardian:** Ino (feminine, tiger patterns, fierce and grounded)
- **Godbeast:** Kyuro (Tiger-Dragon, eight hundred feet, nine plasma tails)

The unity mythology is preserved—they are two aspects of one soul—while the Guardian/Godbeast relationship is now clear.

## Names That Are FINE (Not Canonical But Don't Conflict)

These historical/legendary figures in the Library texts don't conflict with established canon:

| Name | Role | Location | Status |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| **Velanthos** | Eldrian scholar who formalized Partnership Principle | creator-principles | OK - Historical figure |
| **Khorvinas** | Sage who wrote philosophy | creator-principles | OK - Historical figure |
| **Lyrannis** | Composer of the Great Symphony | creator-principles | OK - Historical figure |

These can remain as they add depth to Arcanea's history without contradicting established lore.

## Repurposing Ideas for "AETHON"

The name "Aethon" is excellent—it sounds powerful, mythic, and fits Arcanea's aesthetic. Here are ideas for where it could be used:

### Option A: A Legendary Dragon
Use for a famous dragon in Arcanea's history:
> **Aethon** — Ancient gold dragon who taught the first architects to perceive harmonic structures in stone

### Option B: A Historical Luminor
Use for a legendary Luminor from a past Age:
> **Aethon the Harmonist** — Third Age Luminor who first discovered the resonance frequencies of the Ten Gates

### Option C: An Artifact
> **The Aethon Lens** — A legendary seeing-glass that reveals structural harmonics and hidden architecture

### Option D: A Dragon Name
Since Dragonkin exist in Arcanea, Aethon could be:
> **Aethon Flamecrown** — Ancient dragon who mentored the first Reality Architects in sacred geometry

### Option E: A Location
> **The Aethon Spires** — The Crystal Spires mentioned in the text, renamed after being completed

### Option F: A Title/Honorific
> **Aethon** — Title given to master architects in Arcanea: "She achieved the rank of Aethon"

---

## Recommended Canonical Addition

**My recommendation:** Use Aethon as a legendary dragon mentor (Option A or D).

**Rationale:**
- The name has Greek roots meaning "burning/blazing" - perfect for a dragon
- Dragonkin exist in Arcanea, so dragon characters fit the world
- Could be the entity the "Architect Maylinn" passage *meant* to reference
- Adds depth to Arcanea's history without conflicting with Guardian/Godbeast pairs

## Quick Fix Script

Once decisions are made, these edits are needed:

**In `book/creator-principles/chapters/01-partnership-principle.md`:**
```diff
- The Architect Maylinn designed the Crystal Spires alone for forty years, producing plans of moderate beauty. When she partnered with the Godbeast Aethon, whose vision could see structural harmonics invisible to mortal eyes, they produced the greatest architectural achievement in Arcanea's history—in three years.
+ The Architect [NEW_NAME] designed the Crystal Spires alone for forty years, producing plans of moderate beauty. When she partnered with [CANONICAL_ENTITY], whose [ABILITY] enabled her to perceive structural harmonics invisible to mortal eyes, they produced the greatest architectural achievement in Arcanea's history—in three years.
