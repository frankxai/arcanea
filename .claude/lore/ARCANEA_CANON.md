## Quick Reference Tables

### The Cosmic Duality

| LUMINA | NERO |
|--------|------|
| The First Light | The Primordial Darkness |
| Form-Giver | Fertile Unknown |
| Pattern Weaver | Boundary Maker |
| The Awakener | The Great Return |
| Creation | Potential |
| Mother | Father |
| Day | Night |

**CRITICAL:** Nero is NOT evil. Nero is necessary. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion.

### The Five Elements

| Element | Domain | Color | Feel | Advanced Forms |
|---------|--------|-------|------|----------------|
| **FIRE** | Energy, passion, transformation | Red, orange, gold | Heat, urgency | Lightning, phoenixfire |
| **WATER** | Flow, healing, memory | Blue, silver, crystal | Cool calm, depth | Ice, blood magic (forbidden) |
| **EARTH** | Stability, growth, protection | Green, brown, stone | Grounded, solid | Metal, crystal, constructs |
| **WIND** | Freedom, speed, change | White, silver, invisible | Weightless, swift | Flight, intangibility |
| **VOID/SPIRIT** | Potential & transcendence | Black/Gold, purple/white | Infinite & divine | Pocket dimensions, soul magic |

**The Fifth Element Duality:**
- **VOID** — Nero's aspect: potential, mystery, the unformed, space between
- **SPIRIT** — Lumina's aspect: transcendence, consciousness, the divine, soul

Together they form the complete fifth element, mirroring the cosmic duality at the elemental level.

**NOTE:** Light is Fire's creation aspect. Shadow is corrupted Void (Void without Spirit).

## Writing Guidelines

### Dialogue by Speaker Type

**Common folk say:** "Magic," "The World Tree," "The Great Mother"
**Scholars/Eldrian say:** "The Arcane," "Yggdrasil," "Lumina," "The Song"
**Action scenes:** Short terms — "Force," "Sight," "Gate"

### Show, Don't Explain

**Wrong:** "The Arcane's harmonic frequency adjusted to 432Hz"
**Right:** "The world sang a note so pure it made his bones hum"

### Magic Feels Magical

- Use poetic metaphors not technical terms
- "The Song answered her call" NOT "She manipulated the Arcane field"
- Show ranks through effect, not numbers
