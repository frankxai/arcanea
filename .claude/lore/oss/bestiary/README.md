# The Creative Bestiary

Every creative block is a creature. **Name it to defeat it.**

The Bestiary catalogs the obstacles that plague creators—not as character flaws or personal failures, but as **entities that can be understood, anticipated, and overcome**.

## The Creatures

| Creature | Danger | Primary Symptoms |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| [Perfectionist Wyrm](./perfectionist-wyrm.md) | High | Nothing is ever finished |

## How to Use the Bestiary

### 1. Recognition

When you feel blocked, consult the Bestiary. Often, simply **naming the creature** begins to diminish its power.

> "Ah, the Perfectionist Wyrm is active today."

### 2. Understanding

Each creature has:
- **Habitat** - Where it appears
- **Symptoms** - How to recognize it
- **Weakness** - How to defeat it
- **Prevention** - How to avoid summoning it

### 3. Combat

Apply the creature's specific weakness. Generic advice rarely works; targeted strategies do.

### In Claude Code

```
/bestiary perfectionism

/bestiary "I keep rewriting the same paragraph"
```

## The Wisdom

> *"The creatures are not your weakness. They are universal. Every creator faces them. The difference is whether you have learned their names and weaknesses."*
