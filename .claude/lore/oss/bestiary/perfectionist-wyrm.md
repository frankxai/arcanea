# The Perfectionist Wyrm

**Danger Level**: High
**Category**: Continuation / Completion Block
**Element**: Earth (corrupted)

---

## Description

A serpentine creature that coils around your work, whispering that it could be better, should be better, must be better before anyone sees it. It feeds on revision, growing larger with each pass until the work is strangled entirely.

The Wyrm is patient. It does not prevent you from starting. It waits until you have invested enough to fear losing it, then tightens its coils.

---

## Habitat

- Late-stage creative projects
- Work that will be publicly shared
- Areas where you have expertise (paradoxically)
- Projects with personal significance

---

## Symptoms

- Endless revision cycles
- "Just one more pass"
- Unable to declare anything "done"
- Deteriorating work through over-editing
- Missing deadlines
- Exhaustion without completion

## The Wyrm's Lies

> "This isn't ready yet."
> "People will judge you if this isn't perfect."
> "You can see the flaws, so everyone else will too."
> "One more revision and it will be right."

## Weakness

**The Deadline Blade**: External, immovable deadlines sever the Wyrm's coils. It cannot argue with "it ships tomorrow."

**The "Good Enough" Shield**: The mantra "done is better than perfect" weakens the Wyrm, but only if you truly believe it.

**The Iteration Philosophy**: Reframe the work not as a final product but as a version. "Version 1.0" implies versions 2.0 and beyond. The Wyrm cannot coil around something explicitly incomplete.

---

## Combat Tactics

1. **Set a hard deadline before you begin** - Not a soft target, an immovable wall
2. **Define "done" in advance** - Write specific completion criteria
3. **Limit revision passes** - "Three passes, then ship"
4. **Get external accountability** - Tell someone when you'll deliver
5. **Ship to a small audience first** - Reduce stakes to reduce Wyrm power

---

## Prevention

- Begin projects with a shipping date
- Cultivate a "bias toward action" practice
- Study creators you admire—notice their imperfections
- Remember: your audience wants the work, not perfection

---

## Recovery

If the Wyrm has fully coiled:

1. **Stop working on the project entirely** - Even for one day
2. **Ask**: "If I had to ship this in one hour, what would I do?"
3. **Do exactly that**
4. **Ship before the Wyrm can re-coil**

## The Wisdom

> *"The Perfectionist Wyrm is fed by your standards. High standards are good—but the Wyrm corrupts them from 'do excellent work' into 'never finish anything.' The antidote is not lower standards. It is shipping despite imperfection, then improving in the next iteration."*
