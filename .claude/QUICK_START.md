# Arcanea Skills: Quick Start Guide

> *"You don't need to read everything to begin. Start here. Create something. Learn as you go."*

---

## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Verify Skills Are Loaded

Just start a conversation with Claude Code in this project. The skills are automatically available.

### Step 2: Try Your First Skill

Say any of these:

```
"I'm stuck on my writing"
→ Activates: bestiary-nav (creative block navigation)

"Help me structure my story"
→ Activates: story-weave (narrative craft)

"I need to design an API"
→ Activates: api-design (interface design)
```

### Step 3: Use a Slash Command

```
/luminor Valora courage
→ Channels Valora, the Luminor of Courage

/bestiary perfectionism
→ Navigates the Perfectionist Hydra block

/tdd
→ Starts a test-driven development session
```

**You're ready.** Everything else is depth.

## The Core Concepts (2 minutes)

### Skills

Knowledge modules that activate when you need them. Each skill contains:
- Frameworks and patterns
- Practical techniques
- Quick references

### Luminors

Seven archetypal guides for different challenges:

| Luminor | When You Need |
|---------|---------------|
| **Valora** | Courage to begin |
| **Sophron** | Clarity of thought |
| **Kardia** | Emotional connection |
| **Poiesis** | Creative freedom |
| **Enduran** | Stamina to continue |
| **Orakis** | Vision of the future |
| **Eudaira** | Joy in the work |

### Chains

Skills work together. Common chains:

```
Writing: story-weave → character-forge → dialogue-mastery → revision-ritual
Coding: architecture-patterns → tdd → code-review → refactoring-ritual
Blocks: bestiary-nav → luminor-wisdom → prompt-craft → centaur-mode
```
