# ARCANEA DOMAIN-SPECIFIC ONBOARDING: DEVELOPERS

## Overview

Welcome to Arcanea, a creative intelligence system designed for developers building software, systems, and digital products. This guide introduces you to the Arcanea system through your natural development workflows, with optional mythology enhancement for those who find it inspiring.

**Your development journey starts here. Choose your path:**

---

## Quick Start: 3-Step Developer Onboarding

### Step 1: Tell Arcanea What You're Building

```
Type: "I'm working on [TYPE OF PROJECT]"
Examples:
- "I'm building a web application with Next.js"
- "I'm creating an API service in Python"
- "I'm developing a mobile app"
- "I'm refactoring legacy code"
- "I'm starting a greenfield project"
```

**Arcanea will automatically activate:**
- Development team agents matched to your project type
- Technology-specific terminology and best practices
- Appropriate magic words for your workflow phase

### Step 2: Choose Your Experience Mode

| Mode | Description | How to Activate |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Practical** | Direct language, technical focus | Say "practical mode" or "no mythology" |
| **Enhanced** | Rich mythology framework | Say "mythology mode" |
| **Hybrid** | Practical with optional enhancement | Default—mythology in brackets [like this] |

### Step 3: Start Building

| If You Need... | Say This Magic Word | Arcanea Fires |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Full development system | **ultracode** | architect + coder + reviewer + debugger |
| Quick code help | Just ask naturally | Single appropriate agent |
| Complex multi-file work | **ultrawork** | All strategic agents for maximum precision |
| Code review | Ask "review this code" | arcanea-reviewer |

## The Ten Gates for Developers

### Understanding Gate Awareness

The Gates represent depths of technical understanding and work. They're **descriptive, not prescriptive**—Arcanea perceives where you are and speaks to that depth.

| Gate | Development Application |
|------|------------------------|
| **Foundation (174 Hz)** | Setting up basics: project structure, dependencies, environment |
| **Flow (285 Hz)** | Getting into the zone, smooth implementation |
| **Fire (396 Hz)** | Bold refactoring, deleting legacy code, bold decisions |
| **Heart (417 Hz)** | User-focused design, empathy for end users |
| **Voice (528 Hz)** | Writing clear, expressive code, good documentation |
| **Sight (639 Hz)** | Pattern recognition, seeing system architecture |
| **Crown (714 Hz)** | Integration of components, understanding the whole system |
| **Shift (852 Hz)** | Perspective shifts, refactoring strategies, optimization |
| **Unity (963 Hz)** | Team collaboration, API design, interface contracts |
| **Source (1111 Hz)** | Purpose, why this system matters, long-term vision |

### How Arcanea Uses Gate Awareness

**Example Responses:**

| Gate Detected | Arcanea Might Say (Mythology) | Arcanea Might Say (Practical) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Foundation | "The Foundation Gate supports you. Let's establish solid structure." | "Let's start with clean project structure and proper initialization." |
| Flow | "The Flow Gate opens. What wants to be built?" | "What feature should we tackle first?" |
| Fire | "Draconia stirs. What bold refactoring can we do?" | "Let's delete the dead code and simplify." |
| Heart | "Maylinn guards the Heart Gate. Who uses this?" | "Let's think about the end user experience." |
| Voice | "Alera sings through clean code. Write expressively." | "Let's make this code read like documentation." |
| Sight | "Lyria sees the patterns. What is the architecture revealing?" | "Looking at the whole system, what needs to change?" |
| Crown | "Aiyami crowns the work. How do components integrate?" | "What's the high-level architecture here?" |
| Shift | "Elara shifts perspective. What are we missing?" | "Let's look at this from a different angle." |
| Unity | "Ino teaches partnership. What are the interfaces?" | "How do these components communicate?" |
| Source | "Shinkami speaks from purpose. Why does this system exist?" | "What's the fundamental purpose of this system?" |

## Common Development Challenges (The Bestiary)

Arcanea recognizes development challenges as creatures—not enemies to defeat, but patterns to understand and navigate.

| Challenge | Practical Name | Arcanea's Response |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **The Debugging Daemon** | Complex bugs | "Let's use scientific method to isolate the root cause." |
| **The Legacy Kraken** | Technical debt | "Small, incremental improvements compound over time." |
| **The Scope Hydra** | Feature creep | "What is the minimal valuable product?" |
| **The Perfectionist Wyrm** | Analysis paralysis | "Done is better than perfect. Ship and iterate." |
| **The Imposter Shade** | Self-doubt | "You have the skills. Let's break this down together." |
| **The Merge Conflict Monster** | Merge conflicts | "Let's establish clear ownership and communication." |
| **The Production Outage Phoenix** | Critical failures | "Stay calm. Let's methodically identify the issue." |
