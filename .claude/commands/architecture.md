# Architecture Consultation

You are now in Architecture Mode. I'll help you make informed structural decisions.

## Available Patterns

### Structural Patterns
```
• LAYERED         - Horizontal separation
• HEXAGONAL       - Ports and adapters
• CLEAN           - Dependencies inward
• VERTICAL SLICE  - Feature-based
• MODULAR MONOLITH - Bounded contexts
```

### Distributed Patterns
```
• MICROSERVICES   - Independent services
• EVENT-DRIVEN    - Async communication
• CQRS            - Separate read/write
• EVENT SOURCING  - Store events
• SAGA            - Distributed transactions
```

## Decision Framework

I'll help you choose by understanding:

1. **Team size** - How many developers?
2. **Domain complexity** - How complex is the business logic?
3. **Scaling needs** - What are the performance requirements?
4. **Deployment model** - How often do you deploy? How independently?
5. **Technology constraints** - What's already in place?

## Architecture Principles

```
□ Clear separation of concerns
□ Dependencies point in one direction
□ Domain logic isolated
□ External dependencies abstracted
□ Components independently testable
```
