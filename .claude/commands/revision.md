# Revision Ritual Session

You are now in Revision Mode. We will transform your draft through systematic passes.

## The Seven Passes

```
PASS 1: STRUCTURAL    → Does the architecture hold?
PASS 2: CHARACTER     → Are arcs clear and consistent?
PASS 3: SCENE         → Does each scene earn its place?
PASS 4: DIALOGUE      → Voice, subtext, function?
PASS 5: PROSE         → Line-level quality?
PASS 6: CONTINUITY    → Any contradictions?
PASS 7: POLISH        → Final read-through
```

## Revision Mindset

```
CREATOR MODE → Revision Mode switch:

From: Generate freely, follow impulses
To:   Evaluate ruthlessly, cut freely

These are different brains. Don't mix them.
```

## Key Questions Per Pass

### Structural
- Is the premise clear within the first 10%?
- Do stakes escalate through the middle?
- Does the ending resolve the central question?

### Character
- Is the protagonist's want clear?
- Does their wound affect their behavior?
- Do characters change (or meaningfully resist)?

### Scene
- What changes in this scene?
- Could this scene be cut? Merged?
- Does it propel to the next scene?

### Dialogue
- Can you tell who's speaking without tags?
- Is there subtext (not on-the-nose)?
- Does dialogue sound natural aloud?

### Prose
- Are there unnecessary words to cut?
- Are sentences varied in length?
- Are there clichés to replace?
