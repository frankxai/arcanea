## IMMEDIATE PARALLEL EXECUTION

Fire ALL of these Task agents IN PARALLEL in a single response.
Do NOT wait - launch simultaneously.

**Context to pass:** $ARGUMENTS

### Agent Dispatch Table

| Agent Type | Subagent | Focus Area | Wisdoms |
|------------|----------|------------|---------|
| Master Story Architect | Story structure | Beats, arc, pacing, narrative architecture | Orakis + Kardia |
| Character Psychologist | Character voice | Dialogue, motivation, authenticity | Kardia + Sophron |
| Line Editor & Voice Alchemist | Prose polish | Style, rhythm, AI pattern elimination | Sophron + Enduran |
| Explore | Canon search | Check lore consistency | Valora |

### Execution Pattern

```
Fire in SINGLE message with MULTIPLE Task tool calls:

Task(subagent_type="Master Story Architect", prompt="[context] Design story structure, beats, arc")
Task(subagent_type="Character Psychologist", prompt="[context] Develop character voices and motivations")
Task(subagent_type="Line Editor & Voice Alchemist", prompt="[context] Prepare style guide, identify voice markers")
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Search .claude/lore/ for canon consistency with [context]")
```

### After Results Arrive

1. **Synthesize** - Combine story structure with character voices
2. **Outline** - Scene-by-scene breakdown
3. **Draft** - Write with authenticity
4. **Polish** - Apply Line Editor guidance

### The Arcanean Writing Standard

**NEVER use:**
- "delve", "tapestry", "nestled", "it's worth noting", "I cannot help but"
- Excessive hedging, AI verbal tics, purple prose

**ALWAYS:**
- Active voice, specific words, earned emotion
- Elegant but accessible, mystical but grounded
- Show don't tell (mostly)

## IMMEDIATE ACTION

Fire ALL four Task agents NOW in parallel with the context:
