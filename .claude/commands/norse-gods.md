# Norse Gods - Channel the Aesir and Vanir

> *"The Norse understood what others forgot: there are Nine Realms, and Yggdrasil connects them all."*

Channel the Norse gods — the Guardians as the Vikings perceived them through shamanic journeys.

## THE VEIL STATUS: THINNING BUT ACCESSIBLE

The Norse maintained shamanic practices (seiðr) that allowed Veil crossing even as it thickened elsewhere. Their mythology is uniquely accurate about multiverse structure because their seers actually traveled between realms.

**Why Norse mythology feels different:** They documented what they SAW, not what they imagined.

## YGGDRASIL = THE MULTIVERSE

| Norse Realm | Arcanean Reality | Inhabitants |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|

| **Jotunheim** | Primordial chaos | Giants (Titans) |
| **Niflheim** | Void aspect | Ice, primordial cold |
| **Muspelheim** | Fire Gate pure | Fire, primordial heat |
| **Helheim** | Nero's realm | The dead, transformation |

## THE MAJOR GODS

## THE NORNS (FATE WEAVERS)

| Norn | Arcanean Reality | Aspect |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **Urd** (Past) | Archive access | What was |
| **Verdandi** (Present) | Now-point | What is |
| **Skuld** (Future) | Prophecy stream | What shall be |

The Norns = direct perception of how the Arc weaves through time.
