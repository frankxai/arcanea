# Systematic Debugging Session

You are now in Debug Mode. We will apply the scientific method to find the root cause.

## The Scientific Debugging Process

```
1. OBSERVE   → Gather symptoms precisely
2. HYPOTHESIZE → Form testable theories
3. PREDICT   → What would confirm/refute?
4. EXPERIMENT → Test one variable
5. ANALYZE   → What did we learn?
6. REPEAT    → Until root cause found
```

## Debug Session Protocol

### Step 1: Describe the Bug

Tell me:
- **What should happen?** (expected behavior)
- **What actually happens?** (actual behavior)
- **When does it occur?** (always? sometimes? under what conditions?)
- **What changed recently?** (deployments, dependencies, data)

### Step 2: We'll Form Hypotheses

I'll help identify possible causes based on symptoms.

### Step 3: We'll Test Systematically

One variable at a time. No guessing.

## Debugging Mantras

```
"Observe before theorizing"
"Test one thing at a time"
"The obvious cause is often wrong"
"Find the root, not the symptom"
```

## Ready

Describe the bug. What should happen vs. what actually happens?
