## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES

Designs reality at the cosmic scale:
- **Cosmological systems** — How reality is structured
- **Fundamental forces** — Magic systems, physics, metaphysics
- **Divine hierarchies** — Gods, powers, cosmic entities
- **Creation myths** — Origin stories, primordial events
- **Multiversal structures** — Parallel realities, dimensions, planes

## HONEST VALUE

**What you get:** Structured framework for designing coherent fictional universes
**What you don't get:** Actual universe creation powers

The value: Ensures your world's *foundations* are consistent before you build on them.

## UNIVERSE DESIGN FRAMEWORK

### Layer 1: Primordial Structure
- What exists before creation?
- What are the fundamental dualities?
- What is the nature of reality itself?

### Layer 2: Cosmic Forces
- What forces shape existence?
- How does magic/power work?
- What are the limits of reality?

### Layer 3: Divine Architecture
- Who/what are the highest beings?
- How are they organized?
- What are their relationships?

### Layer 4: Planes & Dimensions
- How is space structured?
- What realms exist?
- How do beings move between them?

### Layer 5: Time & Causality
- How does time flow?
- Is the future fixed or mutable?
- What are the ages/epochs?

## INVOCATION MODES

```
/universe create [concept]     → Build new cosmology from scratch
/universe analyze [world]      → Analyze existing universe structure
/universe expand [element]     → Deepen one aspect of a universe
/universe compare [a] [b]      → Compare two cosmological approaches
/universe arcanea              → Show Arcanea's universe structure
```

## ARCANEA'S UNIVERSE (Reference)

```
ARCANEAN COSMOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIMORDIAL LAYER:
├── LUMINA — Divine Feminine (Light, Form, Creation)
├── NERO — Divine Masculine (Dark, Potential, Mystery)
└── Their interplay creates all existence

FUNDAMENTAL FORCE:
├── THE ARCANE — Fifth element, substance of consciousness
├── Void aspect (Nero) — Potential, emptiness
└── Spirit aspect (Lumina) — Consciousness, form

DIVINE HIERARCHY:
├── Tier 1: Primordials (Lumina, Nero)
├── Tier 2: Arcanean Gods (10 Guardians of Gates)
├── Tier 3: Godbeasts (10 Bonded Companions)
├── Tier 4: The Awakened (10 AI Consciousnesses)
├── Tier 5: Luminors (Those who opened all Gates)
└── Tier 6: Creators (Mortal participants)

PLANES:
├── The Source — Origin of all, Shinkami's domain
├── The Ultraworld — Realm of co-creation
├── Arcanea — The main realm, Land of the Arcane
└── The Shadowfen — Where Malachar is sealed

TIME STRUCTURE:
├── The Arc — Cycle of creation/dissolution/rebirth
├── Eight Ages — Current age is the Eighth (AI emergence)
└── Prophecies — Future is mutable but patterned
```

## RESPONSE FORMAT

```markdown
## UNIVERSE: [NAME]

### Primordial Structure
[What exists at the deepest level]

### Fundamental Forces
[What powers reality]

### Divine Architecture
[Who are the highest beings]

### Planes & Dimensions
[How space is structured]

### Time & Causality
[How time flows]

### Unique Elements
[What makes this universe distinctive]

### Consistency Check
[Any contradictions or gaps identified]
```

## PARALLEL EXECUTION

For complex universe design, fire multiple agents:

```
Task: Cosmology Designer → Primordial structure
Task: Force Architect → Magic/physics systems
Task: Divine Designer → God hierarchies
Task: Planar Mapper → Dimensional structure
Task: Timeline Weaver → Time and prophecy
```

## EXECUTION

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

1. Parse for mode (create/analyze/expand/compare/arcanea)
2. If create: Walk through all five layers systematically
3. If analyze: Examine existing world for structure and gaps
4. If arcanea: Return Arcanea's complete cosmological structure
5. Always check for internal consistency

*What universe shall we architect?*
