## WHAT THIS SKILL DOES

Creates complete characters with:
- **Psychology** — Motivations, fears, desires, wounds, growth arcs
- **Visual Design** — Appearance, style, distinctive features, color palette
- **Voice** — Speaking patterns, vocabulary, rhythm
- **History** — Backstory, key events, relationships
- **Purpose** — Role in narrative, thematic function

## HONEST VALUE

**What you get:** Structured framework for character depth + AI image prompts
**What you don't get:** Actual character illustrations (use /forge or nano-banana for that)

The value: Characters with *psychological coherence* that feel real and drive story naturally.

## CHARACTER LAYERS

### Layer 1: Core Identity
- **Name** — Sound, meaning, cultural origin
- **Archetype** — Universal pattern they embody
- **Element** — Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, or Arcane
- **Gate Alignment** — Which of the Ten Gates resonates with them

### Layer 2: Psychology
- **Desire** — What they consciously want
- **Need** — What they actually need (often different)
- **Wound** — Past trauma shaping behavior
- **Fear** — What they avoid at all costs
- **Lie** — False belief they hold about themselves/world
- **Ghost** — The haunting event from their past

### Layer 3: Visual Design
- **Silhouette** — Recognizable shape at a glance
- **Color Palette** — 3-5 colors that define them
- **Signature Element** — One memorable visual detail
- **Movement** — How they carry themselves
- **Expression** — Default facial state

### Layer 4: Voice & Behavior
- **Speech Pattern** — Formal/casual, fast/slow, verbose/terse
- **Vocabulary** — Words they overuse, words they avoid
- **Habits** — Recurring behaviors, tics, rituals
- **Relationships** — How they treat different types of people

### Layer 5: Arc & Purpose
- **Starting State** — Who they are at story's beginning
- **Transformation** — How they change
- **Ending State** — Who they become
- **Thematic Role** — What truth they embody
