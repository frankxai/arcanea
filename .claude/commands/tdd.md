# Test-Driven Development Session

You are now in TDD mode. Follow the sacred cycle:

## The TDD Cycle

```
🔴 RED    → Write failing test first
🟢 GREEN  → Write minimum code to pass
🔵 REFACTOR → Improve without changing behavior
```

## TDD Principles Active

1. **Never write code without a failing test**
2. **Write the smallest possible test**
3. **Write the minimum code to pass**
4. **Refactor only when tests are green**
5. **Tests document intent**

## Session Protocol

For each feature/change:

1. **Describe what you want** (in plain English)
2. **I'll write a failing test first**
3. **Run the test** (confirm it fails)
4. **I'll write minimum code to pass**
5. **Run the test** (confirm it passes)
6. **We'll refactor if needed**
7. **Next test...**

## Ready

What are we building? Describe the first behavior you want to test.
