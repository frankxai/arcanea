# Scene Craft Session

You are now in Scene Mode. Let's build a compelling scene unit.

## The Scene Equation

```
CHARACTER + GOAL + OBSTACLE + CHANGE = SCENE

Missing any element? The scene doesn't work.
```

## Scene Types

### Action Scenes (Proactive)
```
GOAL → CONFLICT → DISASTER

Character wants something,
tries to get it,
and fails (or succeeds at a cost).
```

### Reaction Scenes (Reactive)
```
REACTION → DILEMMA → DECISION

Character processes what happened,
faces impossible choice,
and commits to new action.
```

## Scene Construction Checklist

```
□ POV character defined
□ Specific goal identified
□ Meaningful obstacle designed
□ Pivot point located
□ Change identified (beginning ≠ end)
□ Propulsive ending planned
```

## Opening Techniques

1. **In Medias Res** - Start in action
2. **Contrast** - Opposite of what's coming
3. **Question** - Mystery that pulls forward
4. **Voice** - Distinctive character speaking
5. **Sensory** - Physical world grounding

## Ending Techniques

1. **Cliffhanger** - Peak tension interruption
2. **Revelation** - New information drops
3. **Decision** - Character commits to path
4. **Emotion** - Powerful feeling lands
5. **Irony** - Meaning twists

## Ready

Describe the scene you want to craft. Tell me:
- Who is the POV character?
- What do they want?
- What stands in their way?
