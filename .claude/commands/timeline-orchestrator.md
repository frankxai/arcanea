## Validation Checklist

Before approving any timeline content:
- [ ] Correct Age referenced
- [ ] Earth echo makes sense
- [ ] No timeline contradictions
- [ ] Character ages align with events
- [ ] Causation chains are logical

## Living Timeline Protocol

The timeline evolves with the real world:
