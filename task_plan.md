# Task Plan: Arcanea Codex Plugin Comparison + Guide + Publish

## Goal
Compare top Codex-related plugins, add a clear usage/value guide, critique the current setup, and publish a standalone `arcanea-codex` GitHub repo.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [ ] Phase 3: Execute/build
- [ ] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. Which Codex/OpenCode plugins lead by stars and what do they do well?
2. What docs best explain Arcanea Codex to new users (who, why, how)?
3. What pain points or gaps exist in the current Arcanea Codex bundle?
4. Which GitHub org/user should own `arcanea-codex`?

## Decisions Made
- Use GitHub search to identify top Codex/OpenCode plugins by stars.

## Errors Encountered
- `gh repo create` push failed: `git: 'remote-https' is not a git command` (HTTPS helper missing).

## Status
**Currently in Phase 3** - Writing comparison, guide, and critique docs; preparing GitHub publish.
