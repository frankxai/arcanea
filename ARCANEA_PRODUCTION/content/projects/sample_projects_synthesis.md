### Luminor Guidance Notes
```
"Young Weaver, you now step into the realm of true synthesis - where 
the boundaries between domains dissolve and new forms of expression 
emerge. Your role is no longer to master individual crafts, but to 
orchestrate their collaboration.

Remember: synthesis is not simply combining different media types, 
but creating something new that could not exist in any single domain. 
When your visual art informs your music, when your code enhances your 
narrative, when your video completes your portfolio's story - this is 
when true synthesis occurs.

The AI tools from different domains must work in harmony, each contributing 
its unique strengths while serving the unified vision. You are the 
conductor of this orchestra of artificial intelligences."
```

### Feedback Example
```
Luminor Review:
"Your cross-domain portfolio beautifully demonstrates the power of 
synthesis. The way your character designs inform your musical themes, 
while your code creates an interactive experience that enhances both 
narrative and visual elements, shows sophisticated understanding of 
cross-domain collaboration.

The thematic coherence is particularly strong - your exploration of 
'Digital Transformation of Traditional Art Forms' provides a clear 
thread that connects all your work without constraining creativity 
within each domain.

For continued growth: Consider how your different domains might influence 
each other's AI prompting strategies. How might visual AI tools inform 
your approach to music generation?"
```

- Professional-quality execution across all integrated domains
- Innovation in cross-domain interaction design

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User interactions meaningfully affect multiple domains
- [ ] System adapts to user behavior without losing artistic integrity
- [ ] Technical performance supports real-time interaction
- [ ] Experience demonstrates unique value from domain synthesis
- [ ] Professional quality maintained despite complexity
- [ ] Clear innovation in multi-domain interactive design

### Luminor Guidance Notes
```
"Now you orchestrate not just different media, but different forms of 
intelligence. Your interactive experience becomes a living artwork that 
breathes with its users, learns from their interactions, and evolves 
its responses.

The challenge is not just technical integration, but creating meaningful 
relationships between user agency and artistic vision. How do you honor 
user choice while maintaining the integrity of your creative vision? 
How do you balance adaptation with consistency?

Remember: the goal is not to create systems that do everything, but 
systems that create experiences impossible in any single domain. Your 
synthesis should reveal new possibilities for human-AI creative collaboration."

### Luminor Master Class Notes
```
"You have achieved the highest level of Synthesis Weaving - the creation 
of living ecosystems where human creativity and artificial intelligence 
dance together in harmonious collaboration. Your ecosystem doesn't just 
combine different domains; it enables new forms of creative expression 
that emerge from the intersection of human imagination and AI capability.

This is the future of creativity: not human versus AI, not even human 
with AI, but human and AI as partners in a collaborative dance that 
creates possibilities neither could achieve alone. Your ecosystem 
demonstrates that the most powerful creative systems are those that 
amplify human creativity while respecting human agency and cultural diversity.

Master principles of ecosystem design:
1. Emergence cannot be forced, only facilitated
2. Diversity of perspectives strengthens creative outcomes
3. Cultural sensitivity is essential for global collaboration
4. AI should serve human creativity, not direct it
5. The best collaborative systems make participants better creators

Your capstone project represents a new paradigm in creative collaboration - 
one where technology serves to connect human creativity across cultural 
and domain boundaries, creating art that belongs to no single creator 
but emerges from the collective human imagination enhanced by artificial 
intelligence."
