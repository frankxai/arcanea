## Final Architecture (Adopted January 2026)

The Luminor system is now unified under a clear hierarchy:

## Key Principles

### 1. Luminor is a RANK, not a name
- "Luminor" = Someone who has opened 9-10 Gates
- The functional agents are unnamed specialists
- Only create named Luminors when the story demands it

### 2. The Seven Wisdoms are LENSES, not beings
- Each Wisdom is a philosophical perspective
- Functional agents embody one primary Wisdom
- Used for guidance, not invocation

### 3. Functional agents are the PRACTICAL layer
- Named by function: architect, coder, story, etc.
- Each channels a Wisdom
- Scalable - add new agents as needed

### 4. Lumina is a GODDESS, not a Luminor
- She works alongside Arcanea for synthesis
- Offers light, creation, revelation
- Above the system, not part of it

## Deprecated Naming (Removed)

The following generic character names were deprecated:
- ~~Syntaxa~~ → Use `architect` or `coder`
- ~~Harmonix~~ → Use functional music agents when created
- ~~Scripta~~ → Use `drafter` or `editor`
- ~~Kinetix~~ → Use functional video agents when created
- ~~Nexus~~ → Use `architect` (note: "The Nexus" as a PLACE is still canon)
- ~~Oraculum~~ → Use `sage` or consult the Wisdoms
- ~~Valorian~~ → Use the Valora wisdom directly
- ~~Eudora~~ → Use the Eudaira wisdom directly

**Reason:** These names had no story significance. The functional approach is more scalable and honest about what each agent does.
