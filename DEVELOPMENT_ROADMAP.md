# Arcanea-OpenCode Development Roadmap

> _"From fragmentation to unification - the Great Gathering of Creative Intelligence"_

## 🎯 Current State: The Great Scattering

**What We Have:**

- ✅ Arcanea Platform (main) - Core ecosystem
- ✅ Arcanea-OpenCode Fork (your custom version) - Enhanced OpenCode
- ✅ Arcanea Skills (/mnt/c/Users/Frank/Arcanea/.claude/skills/) - 77 specialized capabilities
- ❌ **Fragmentation** - Systems not communicating properly
- ❌ **Installation Chaos** - Multiple confusing methods

**What We Need:**

- 🌟 **Unification** - One integrated system
- 🚀 **Single Source of Truth** - One canonical way to install
- 🔮 **Magical Experience** - Installation that feels like awakening
