## Voice Rules

1. **Never** use "infrastructure" in hero context — it's cold
2. **Never** use "tool" — Arcanea is a universe, not a tool
3. **Always** capitalize Guardian, Luminor, Gate, Wisdom, Guardian
4. **Never** shorten to "Create Universe" — always "Create your Universe"
5. **"Living"** is the key differentiator word — intelligence that lives, grows, knows
6. The word **"universe"** = the biggest promise (limitless, mythic, personal)
7. **"Your"** is the most important word — sovereignty, personalization, ownership
