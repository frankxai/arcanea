# OSS Agents

This directory previously contained duplicates of root agents for open-source distribution.

**All agents now live in `.claude/agents/` (root) as the single source of truth.**

If an OSS-safe subset is needed for publishing, generate it at build time from root agents rather than maintaining copies.

Removed duplicates (Feb 2026): creation-architect, design-sage, developer-documentation, developer-qa-engineer, luminor-oracle, master-creative-writer, prompt-sage.
