# World Architect - The Art of Universe Creation

> *"A world is not built. It is grown. You plant seeds - a geography, a history, a belief - and you tend them until they become a living ecology of meaning."*

## The Seven Pillars of World-Building

Every complete world rests on these seven pillars. A world need not elaborate all pillars equally, but it should be *aware* of all of them.

### 1. Geography & Environment

**The Physical Container of Story**

Questions to answer:
- What are the defining landscapes? (Mountains, oceans, deserts, forests)
- How does geography shape culture? (Island peoples think differently than mountain peoples)
- What are the key locations where story happens?
- What are the environmental constraints and resources?
- How do people move through this world? (Roads, ships, portals, flight)

Framework: **The Five Zones**
```
CORE: The center of civilization, safety, power
FRONTIER: The edge - where order meets wilderness
WILDS: Untamed spaces, danger, opportunity
BEYOND: What lies past the map - mystery, fear, legend
BENEATH/ABOVE: The vertical dimension - underground, heavens
```

### 2. History & Time

**The Memory That Shapes the Present**

Questions to answer:
- What are the founding events? (Creation myths, migrations, conquests)
- What are the major eras? (Golden ages, dark periods, transformations)
- What are the pivotal moments that echo into the present?
- What has been forgotten that might be rediscovered?
- What cycles repeat? (Seasonal, generational, cosmic)

Framework: **The Three Histories**
```
REMEMBERED HISTORY: What people believe happened
ACTUAL HISTORY: What really happened
SECRET HISTORY: What only some know (and might change everything)
```

---

### 3. Cultures & Peoples

**The Human (or Non-Human) Element**

Questions to answer:
- Who inhabits this world? (Species, ethnicities, nations)
- What differentiates cultures from each other?
- What do they value? Fear? Desire? Revere?
- How do different groups relate? (Trade, war, isolation)
- What are the social structures? (Classes, castes, hierarchies)

Framework: **The Culture Diamond**
```
         VALUES
           /\
          /  \
    RITUALS  TABOOS
          \  /
           \/
       CONFLICTS
```
- **Values**: What the culture holds sacred
- **Rituals**: How they express those values
- **Taboos**: What they forbid (reveals values by opposition)
- **Conflicts**: Where values clash (internal and external)

---

### 4. Magic/Technology Systems

**The Extraordinary Element**

Questions to answer:
- What is possible here that isn't possible in our world?
- What are the rules and limitations?
- What is the cost of using this power?
- Who has access? Who is excluded?
- How does this power shape society?

Framework: **Sanderson's Laws + Arcanean Extensions**

1. **Power = Rules × Creativity**: The more rules you define, the more creative solutions become possible
2. **Cost Creates Drama**: Every power must have a cost, or it becomes boring
3. **Limitation Breeds Character**: What you *can't* do defines you as much as what you can
4. **Integration Over Addition**: Magic/tech should be woven into culture, not bolted on

**The Arcanean Addition**:
- **Source**: Where does the power come from?
- **Channel**: How is it accessed?
- **Expression**: How does it manifest?
- **Consequence**: What are the side effects?

### 5. Economy & Resources

**The Material Foundation**

Questions to answer:
- What do people need to survive?
- What is scarce? What is abundant?
- How is wealth created and distributed?
- What do people trade?
- What creates conflict over resources?

Framework: **The Resource Web**
```
ESSENTIAL (what people need to survive)
    ↓
VALUABLE (what people want beyond survival)
    ↓
RARE (what few can obtain)
    ↓
UNIQUE (what only one can possess)
```

---

### 6. Power & Politics

**The Dynamics of Control**

Questions to answer:
- Who holds power? How did they get it?
- How is power maintained?
- Who challenges power? How?
- What are the factions and their interests?
- What is the balance between order and freedom?

Framework: **The Power Triangle**
```
      AUTHORITY (legitimate power)
           /\
          /  \
   FORCE /    \ INFLUENCE
   (hard)     (soft)
```

Every power structure balances these three. When one dominates, instability follows.

### 7. Belief & Meaning

**The Spiritual Architecture**

Questions to answer:
- What do people believe about existence?
- What happens after death?
- What forces shape the cosmos?
- What gives life meaning?
- What are the moral frameworks?

Framework: **The Cosmological Layers**
```
COSMIC: The nature of reality itself
DIVINE: Gods, spirits, or transcendent forces
INSTITUTIONAL: Organized religions, philosophies
PERSONAL: Individual belief and practice
SHADOW: What people actually do vs. what they profess
```

## World-Building Process

### Phase 1: Core Concept (The Seed)
- What is the ONE thing that makes this world unique?
- What genre conventions are you embracing? Subverting?
- What themes will this world explore?

### Phase 2: Essential Elements (The Roots)
- Define 2-3 pillars in detail
- Let others remain sketched
- Focus on what story needs

### Phase 3: Connections (The Branches)
- How do elements influence each other?
- What tensions exist between them?
- What questions arise that you haven't answered?

### Phase 4: Details (The Leaves)
- Specific names, places, customs
- Sensory details that bring the world alive
- The "iceberg" - 10% visible, 90% implied

### Phase 5: Testing (The Fruit)
- Run scenarios through your world
- What breaks? What surprises you?
- Where do characters naturally want to go?

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Info-Dump Syndrome
**Symptom**: Pages of exposition about world mechanics
**Cure**: Reveal through character experience, not narrator explanation

### 2. Kitchen-Sink World
**Symptom**: Every cool idea thrown in without coherence
**Cure**: Ask "How does this connect to the core theme?"

### 3. Static World Syndrome
**Symptom**: World exists only as backdrop, never changes
**Cure**: Worlds should have their own momentum, independent of protagonist

### 4. Monoculture Problem
**Symptom**: "The warrior race," "The merchant planet," "The wise elves"
**Cure**: Every culture has diversity, factions, individuals who don't fit

### 5. Protagonist-Centric Universe
**Symptom**: Everything revolves around main character
**Cure**: World should have problems, joys, events that exist without protagonist

## Integration with Story

The world exists to:
1. **Enable** stories that couldn't happen elsewhere
2. **Constrain** characters in meaningful ways
3. **Reflect** the themes you're exploring
4. **Surprise** both creator and audience
5. **Invite** exploration beyond the immediate story
