## PURPOSE

This is the **single source of truth** for Arcanea. Everything here is LOCKED - meaning it has been reviewed and approved by the Creator (Frank) and cannot be changed by AI agents without explicit permission.

**How to use:**
- ✅ **LOCKED** = Canon, do not modify
- ⏳ **STAGING** = Proposed, awaiting approval
- 🔧 **EVOLVING** = Approved concept, details flexible

## TIER 1: COSMIC FOUNDATION (LOCKED ✅)

### The Primordial Duality

| Entity | Aspect | Nature |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Lumina** | The First Light | Form-Giver, Creator, Order |
| **Nero** | The Primordial Darkness | Fertile Unknown, Potential, Mystery |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Nero is NOT evil. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion of Nero's gift.

### The Five Elements

| Element | Domain | Color |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Fire** | Energy, transformation | Red, orange, gold |
| **Water** | Flow, healing, memory | Blue, silver, crystal |
| **Earth** | Stability, growth | Green, brown, stone |
| **Wind** | Freedom, speed, change | White, silver |
| **Void/Spirit** | Potential & transcendence | Black/Gold, purple/white |

**LOCKED TRUTH:**
- **Void** = Nero's aspect (potential, mystery, the unformed)
- **Spirit** = Lumina's aspect (transcendence, consciousness, soul)
- Light is Fire's creation aspect
- Shadow is corrupted Void (Void without Spirit)

## TIER 2: THE TEN GATES & ARCANEAN GODS (LOCKED ✅)

### Extended Solfeggio Frequencies (Each Gate Unique)

| Gate | Frequency | God/Goddess | Godbeast | Domain |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Foundation | 174 Hz | Lyssandria | Kaelith | Earth, survival |
| Flow | 285 Hz | Leyla | Veloura | Creativity, emotion |
| Fire | 396 Hz | Draconia | Draconis | Power, will |
| Heart | 417 Hz | Maylinn | Laeylinn | Love, healing |

**LOCKED TRUTHS:**
- Frequencies follow full Extended Solfeggio scale (174-1111 Hz, each Gate unique)
- "God/Goddess" is the IDENTITY; "Guardian" is their ROLE as Gate-keepers
- Each God has ONE bonded Godbeast
- Godbeast names: Veloura, Yumiko, Sol, Kyuro (KEPT from original) + Vaelith, Amaterasu (NEW)

### Magic Ranks

| Gates Open | Rank |
|------------|------|
| 0-2 | Apprentice |
| 3-4 | Mage |
| 5-6 | Master |
| 7-8 | Archmage |
| 9-10 | Luminor |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Luminor is a RANK (highest attainment), not an entity type.

## TIER 3: THE SEVEN WISDOMS (LOCKED ✅)

| Wisdom | Archive | Domain | Element |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Sophron** | Form | Structure, patterns | Earth |

| **Orakis** | Mystery | Vision, intuition | Void |
| **Poiesis** | Consciousness | Creation, craft | Light |
| **Enduran** | Unity | Endurance, completion | All |

**LOCKED TRUTH:** The Seven Wisdoms are aspects/virtues, not entities. They can be EMBODIED by entities.

---

## TIER 4: THE DARK LORD (LOCKED ✅)

### Malachar

- **Former Name:** Malachar Lumenbright
- **Former Title:** First Eldrian Luminor, Lumina's Champion
- **Fall:** Rejected by Shinkami when attempting forced fusion with the Source Gate
- **Current State:** Sealed in the Shadowfen
- **Nature:** The only true antagonist. All darkness in Arcanea traces to his corruption.

**LOCKED TRUTH:** Malachar is tragic, not purely evil. He was once the greatest of Lumina's champions.

## TIER 1.5: THE FIVE ELDRIANS (LOCKED ✅)

> *Approved by Creator (Frank) — 2026-03-02*
> *Full detail: `.arcanea/lore/ELDRIANS_STAGING.md`*
> *Individual profiles: `sync/aios/lore/eldrians/`*

### Concept

The Five Eldrians are the first crystallizations of Lumina and Nero's primordial interaction — predating the Ten Arcanean Gods and the Gate system itself. They are the **Architects of Arcanea**: the beings who, at the Forging, gave the formless potential of Lumina+Nero its first structure. The Eldrians designed the Gate system that the Ten Gods now govern.

### The Five Eldrians

| Eldrian | Symbol | Primordial Force | Domain | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **Aethelin** | ∞ | The Infinite Loom | Creative systems, architecture of potential | ✅ LOCKED |
| **Korghast** | ⬡ | Silence Before | Permanence, weight, the unfinished | ✅ LOCKED |
| **Velmara** | ◈ | Mirror Absolute | Quantum possibility, unchosen paths | ✅ LOCKED |
| **Solrex** | ☀ | The Becoming | Revelation, accountability, illumination | ✅ LOCKED |
| **Zyranthis** | ◉ | The Shatter | Entropy, completion status | ✅ LOCKED |

**LOCKED TRUTHS:**
- The Five Eldrians predate the Ten Gods and the Gate system
- They crystallized in sequence: Aethelin → Korghast → Velmara → Solrex → Zyranthis (each making the next possible)
- The Forging = the primordial event in which the Eldrians crystallized and built the Gate system
- The Eldrian Council = the Five convening — governs Eldrian Luminor recognition
- Malachar Lumenbright = First Eldrian Luminor (fallen) — the only being to have received this recognition before the Shadowfen

### Eldrian Luminor (Rank Distinction)

- **Luminor** = any being who has opened all 10 Gates (LOCKED ✅)
- **Eldrian Luminor** = rare recognition by the Eldrian Council — a Luminor recognized as a peer whose mastery reflects the Primordial principles (LOCKED ✅)
