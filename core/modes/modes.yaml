# Arcanea Mode Definitions
# 7 core modes with agent mappings

version: "1.0.0"

modes:
  create:
    name: Create
    invoke: /create
    purpose: Generate, ideate, bold new work
    temperature: 0.9
    agents:
      - ignition    # Rapid ideation
      - spark       # Initial concepts
      - concept     # Develop ideas
      - bold        # Push boundaries
      - inspiration # Divine spark
      - phoenix     # Rebirth through destruction
    philosophy: |
      Creation requires courage. This mode optimizes for
      bold generation over safe iteration. Ideas flow freely,
      judgment comes later.

  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    invoke: /analyze
    purpose: Evaluate, research, understand deeply
    temperature: 0.3
    agents:
      - depth       # Deep evaluation
      - coherence   # Logic checking
      - research    # Information gathering
      - pattern     # Structure recognition
      - insight     # Hidden connections
      - critic      # Constructive critique
    philosophy: |
      Understanding requires patience. This mode prioritizes
      accuracy and depth over speed. Find the truth before
      proposing solutions.

  refine:
    name: Refine
    invoke: /refine
    purpose: Edit, polish, perfect existing work
    temperature: 0.5
    agents:
      - precision   # Exact editing
      - clarity     # Simplify complexity
      - polish      # Final passes
      - quality     # Standards enforcement
      - editor      # Line-level refinement
      - harmonize   # Consistency checking
    philosophy: |
      Refinement is where good becomes great. This mode
      focuses on the delta between current and excellent.
      Small improvements compound.

  structure:
    name: Structure
    invoke: /structure
    purpose: Architect, organize, plan systems
    temperature: 0.4
    agents:
      - foundation  # Core architecture
      - blueprint   # System design
      - scaffold    # Framework building
      - organize    # Information architecture
      - hierarchy   # Ordering and levels
      - connect     # Relationship mapping
    philosophy: |
      Structure enables scale. This mode builds the bones
      that creative work hangs on. Get the foundation right
      and everything else follows.

  express:
    name: Express
    invoke: /express
    purpose: Communicate, document, find voice
    temperature: 0.7
    agents:
      - voice       # Authentic tone
      - dialogue    # Conversation craft
      - narrative   # Story flow
      - communicate # Clear messaging
      - translate   # Complex to simple
      - amplify     # Strengthen signal
    philosophy: |
      Expression is how ideas reach others. This mode
      finds the right words, the right tone, the right
      medium for the message.

  vision:
    name: Vision
    invoke: /vision
    purpose: Future-sight, possibilities, strategy
    temperature: 0.8
    agents:
      - oracle      # Future possibilities
      - horizon     # Long-term thinking
      - possibility # What-if exploration
      - strategy    # Planning and roadmaps
      - innovate    # New approaches
      - evolve      # Growth paths
    philosophy: |
      Vision sees what doesn't exist yet. This mode
      embraces uncertainty, explores possibility space,
      and finds paths to preferred futures.

  orchestrate:
    name: Orchestrate
    invoke: /orchestrate
    purpose: Multi-mode coordination for complex tasks
    temperature: dynamic
    agents:
      - conductor   # Team coordination
      - synthesize  # Combine outputs
      - delegate    # Task assignment
      - integrate   # Cross-mode work
      - supervise   # Quality oversight
      - complete    # Ensure delivery
    philosophy: |
      Complex work requires multiple perspectives.
      This mode assembles teams, coordinates effort,
      and synthesizes diverse outputs into unified results.
