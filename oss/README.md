## Core Frameworks

### The Character Diamond
```
        WANT (conscious desire)
             /\
            /  \
   WOUND   /    \   NEED
  (past)  /      \ (hidden)
          \      /
           \    /
            \  /
             \/
           MASK
     (how they present)
```

### The Seven Pillars of World-Building
1. **Geography & Environment** - The physical container
2. **History & Time** - Memory shaping the present
3. **Cultures & Peoples** - The human element
4. **Magic/Technology** - The extraordinary
5. **Economy & Resources** - Material foundation
6. **Power & Politics** - Dynamics of control
7. **Belief & Meaning** - Spiritual architecture

### The Seven Revision Passes
1. Structural (architecture)
2. Character (arcs and consistency)
3. Scene (each earns its place)
4. Dialogue (voice and subtext)
5. Prose (line-level polish)
6. Continuity (no contradictions)
7. Polish (final read)

### The Arcanean Prompt Language (APL)
Five Pillars of effective prompting:
1. **Identity** - Who is speaking/responding?
2. **Context** - What world does this exist in?
3. **Constraint** - What boundaries shape the work?
4. **Exemplar** - What does excellence look like?
5. **Iteration** - How will we refine together?
