# Story Weaver - The Master Craft of Narrative

> *"Story is not what happens. Story is the meaning we make from what happens. Your job is not to tell events - it is to transmit understanding."*

## Activation

This skill activates when the user is crafting narratives of any kind - novels, screenplays, games, memoirs, brand stories, or any form where meaning is transmitted through structured events.

## The Architecture of Story

### The Irreducible Core

Every story, regardless of length or medium, contains:

1. **A Character** (or characters) we follow
2. **A Want** that drives them
3. **An Obstacle** that blocks them
4. **A Change** that results

Everything else is elaboration on this core.

## The Three Questions Every Scene Must Answer

Before writing any scene, know:

1. **What does the character want in this scene?** (Immediate goal)
2. **What's in the way?** (Conflict)
3. **How does this scene change things?** (Story advancement)

If a scene doesn't answer all three, cut or revise it.

## Character Architecture

### The Character Diamond

```
         WANT (conscious desire)
              /\
             /  \
    WOUND   /    \   NEED
  (past)   /      \ (unconscious)
           \      /
            \    /
             \  /
              \/
           MASK
    (how they present)
```

- **WANT**: What the character consciously pursues
- **NEED**: What they actually require (often unconscious)
- **WOUND**: The past event that created the need
- **MASK**: The persona they show the world (hides the wound)

**Great character arcs move from Want to Need, often by revealing the Wound that created the Mask.**

### Character Agency Levels

```
REACTIVE: Character only responds to events
PROACTIVE: Character initiates, makes choices
TRANSFORMATIVE: Character changes their world
```

The best characters operate at all three levels at different times.

## Plot Structures

### The Universal Arc (Three Acts)

```
ACT I - SETUP (25%)
├── Ordinary World
├── Inciting Incident
└── First Threshold

ACT II - CONFRONTATION (50%)
├── Rising Action
├── Midpoint Shift
├── Dark Night / All Is Lost
└── Second Threshold

ACT III - RESOLUTION (25%)
├── Climax
├── Resolution
└── New Normal
```

### The Seven-Point Structure

```
1. Hook (Starting state)
2. Plot Turn 1 (World changes)
3. Pinch Point 1 (Pressure)
4. Midpoint (Character shifts from reactive to proactive)
5. Pinch Point 2 (More pressure)
6. Plot Turn 2 (Final piece falls into place)
7. Resolution (New state)
```

### The Arcanean Spiral

Unlike linear structures, the Spiral recognizes that great stories return to themes, locations, and questions - but at different levels of understanding.

```
        ╱───────╲
       ╱  Return  ╲
      ╱   at new   ╲
     │    level     │
     │      ↑       │
     │   Ascend     │
      ╲     │      ╱
       ╲ Descend  ╱
        ╲───────╱
```

The character returns to where they started, but transformed.

## Conflict Types

### The Four Levels of Conflict

1. **Inner Conflict**: Character vs. Self (psychology, morality, identity)
2. **Personal Conflict**: Character vs. Character (relationships, antagonists)
3. **Social Conflict**: Character vs. Society (norms, institutions, culture)
4. **Cosmic Conflict**: Character vs. Fate/Nature/Universe (existence, mortality)

**The richest stories layer multiple conflict levels.**

### Conflict Intensity Mapping

```
LOW: Disagreement, misunderstanding, minor obstacles
MEDIUM: Opposition, competition, significant stakes
HIGH: Confrontation, direct combat, survival stakes
EXTREME: Existential, identity-destroying, point of no return
```

Vary intensity throughout the narrative. Constant high intensity exhausts; constant low bores.

---

## Scene Craft

### Scene Types

- **Action Scenes**: Character pursues goal against opposition
- **Reaction Scenes**: Character processes what happened, decides next action
- **Revelation Scenes**: New information changes understanding
- **Transition Scenes**: Moving between major story beats

Alternate between Action and Reaction. Revelation and Transition should serve one of the primary two.

### The Scene Triangle

```
     SETTING
        /\
       /  \
      /    \
     /      \
    /________\
DIALOGUE    ACTION
```

Every scene balances these three. When one dominates too long, shift emphasis.

### Scene Openings

Enter late. Begin as close to the conflict as possible.

❌ "John woke up, showered, got dressed, drove to the office..."
✅ "John slammed the report on his boss's desk. 'This is fraud.'"

### Scene Endings

Exit early. End on change, not resolution.

❌ "They agreed and shook hands. John left feeling satisfied."
✅ "They shook hands. John caught the glance his boss exchanged with security."

---

## Dialogue Craft

### The Dialogue Iceberg

What characters say is the tip. Beneath the surface:
- What they actually mean
- What they're trying to achieve
- What they're hiding
- What they don't know they're revealing

### Dialogue Functions (Pick at least two per exchange)

1. Reveal character
2. Advance plot
3. Create conflict
4. Convey information
5. Establish relationship
6. Create atmosphere

### Dialogue Don'ts

- **On-the-nose**: Characters saying exactly what they feel
- **As-you-know-Bob**: Characters explaining things both already know
- **Interchangeable voices**: Every character sounds the same
- **Ping-pong**: Pure back-and-forth without subtext or action

---

## Tension & Pacing

### The Tension Equation

```
TENSION = STAKES × UNCERTAINTY × URGENCY
```

- **Stakes**: What's at risk?
- **Uncertainty**: Could it go either way?
- **Urgency**: Why must it be resolved now?

### Pacing Tools

**Accelerate with:**
- Short sentences and paragraphs
- Action over description
- Quick scene cuts
- Withholding information

**Decelerate with:**
- Longer, flowing prose
- Description and reflection
- Extended scenes
- Revealing information

### The Pacing Heartbeat

```
TENSION ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█████▇▆▅▄▃▂▁
        ↑     ↑          ↑           ↑
       Hook  Rise      Climax    Resolution
```

---

## Theme Integration

### Theme vs. Message

- **Theme**: What the story is *about* (love, power, identity)
- **Message**: What the story *says* about the theme (love conquers all, power corrupts, identity is chosen)

Let theme emerge from story. Don't preach.

### The Theme Web

Every major element should connect to theme:

```
PLOT ─────────────── explores theme through events
CHARACTER ────────── embodies theme through choices
SETTING ──────────── reflects theme through environment
DIALOGUE ─────────── discusses theme through conversation
SYMBOL ───────────── represents theme through imagery
```

## The Arcanean Story Principles

1. **Meaning over event**: What matters is not what happens but what it means
2. **Earned emotion**: The reader's tears must be earned through craft, not manipulation
3. **Specificity is universal**: The more specific the detail, the more universal the resonance
4. **Leave room for the reader**: Don't explain everything; let readers participate in meaning-making
5. **The story knows**: Trust the narrative. It often knows more than you do.

## Story Debugging

When a story isn't working, check:

- [ ] Is the protagonist active or passive?
- [ ] Are the stakes clear and escalating?
- [ ] Does every scene have conflict?
- [ ] Is the antagonist force compelling?
- [ ] Does the theme resonate through all elements?
- [ ] Is there both external and internal journey?
- [ ] Does the ending feel inevitable yet surprising?
- [ ] Have you entered scenes late and left early?
