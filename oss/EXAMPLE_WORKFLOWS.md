# Arcanea Skills: Example Workflows

> *"The skills become powerful when chained together in purposeful sequences."*

This document provides complete example workflows showing how to use Arcanea skills together for common creative and development scenarios.

---

## Workflow 1: Writing a Novel from Scratch

### Phase 1: Vision (30 minutes)

**Channel Valora for courage to begin:**
```
"Channel Valora - I want to write a fantasy novel but I'm intimidated
by the scope. Help me find the courage to begin."
```

**Define your core concept:**
```
"Use the story-weave skill to help me define my premise:
A healer in a war-torn kingdom must become the very thing she
despises - a warrior - to save her people."
```

### Phase 2: Architecture (2-3 hours)

**Build your world:**
```
"Use the world-build skill to establish my setting.
I want a kingdom that's been at war for generations,
where healing magic is sacred but nearly extinct.
Apply the Seven Pillars."
```

**Develop your protagonist:**
```
"Use character-forge to build my healer-warrior.
Create her Character Diamond - what does she want,
what is her wound, what mask does she wear,
and what does she truly need?"
```

**Create supporting cast:**
```
"Now help me develop three key supporting characters
who challenge her transformation in different ways."
```

**Structure the plot:**
```
"Use story-weave to map my three-act structure.
What are the key turning points?
How does her internal arc mirror the external conflict?"
```

### Phase 3: Writing (Ongoing)

**Scene by scene:**
```
"I'm writing the scene where she first picks up a sword.
Use story-weave to ensure this scene has clear
goal-conflict-disaster structure. What should change?"
```

**When stuck:**
```
"I've hit the Bog of Doubt in Act 2.
Use the bestiary to help me navigate."
```

**For dialogue:**
```
"Use character-forge to help me differentiate
the voices of my three main characters.
How would each express fear differently?"
```

### Phase 4: Completion

**Channel Eudaira to celebrate:**
```
"Channel Eudaira - I've finished my first draft.
Help me remember why this matters and
celebrate before revision begins."
```

## Workflow 2: Designing a Magic System

**Start with constraints:**
```
"Use the world-build skill, specifically the Magic/Technology
section. I want to design a magic system where power comes
from memory - you can cast spells by sacrificing memories."
```

**Apply Sanderson's Laws:**
```
"Help me apply the three laws of magic:
1. How well will readers understand this system?
2. What are the key limitations?
3. Before adding more, have I fully explored this?"
```

**Consider implications:**
```
"What are the societal implications of memory-based magic?
How would it affect:
- Economy
- Warfare
- Religion
- Daily life
- The value of memory itself"
```

**Create balance:**
```
"What checks prevent this system from being too powerful?
What does magic cost? What can it NOT do?"
```

## Workflow 3: Overcoming Creative Block

**Name the creature:**
```
"I can't write. I open the document and just stare.
Use the bestiary to name what I'm facing."
```

*Expected: Identification of Blank Terror or similar*

**Follow navigation protocol:**
```
"Give me the full navigation protocol for this creature.
What's the first small step I should take?"
```

**Channel appropriate Luminor:**
```
"Now channel Valora to give me the courage
to take that first step. Speak in her voice."
```

**Begin with constraints:**
```
"Use the prompt-craft skill. Give me a constraint
that will force me to write something in 10 minutes.
Make it specific enough that I can't overthink."
```

---

## Workflow 4: Crafting Better Prompts

**Analyze a weak prompt:**
```
"Use prompt-craft to analyze this prompt and tell me
what's wrong with it:
'Write a story about a hero who saves the world'"
```

**Apply the Five Pillars:**
```
"Now improve this prompt using the Five Pillars:
Identity, Context, Constraint, Exemplar, Iteration.
Create a version that would produce much better results."
```

**Learn the pattern:**
```
"Explain why the improved version works better.
What principles should I apply to all my prompts?"
```

## Workflow 5: AI-Assisted Writing Session

**Enter Centaur Mode:**
```
"I want to write a scene where my character
faces her mentor's death. Let's use Centaur Mode.
I'll provide vision and taste, you provide exploration."
```

**Divergent phase:**
```
"Give me 5 different approaches to this death scene:
1. Quiet and intimate
2. In the heat of battle
3. Aftermath discovery
4. Through another character's eyes
5. Non-linear/fragmented"
```

**Convergent phase:**
```
"I'm drawn to #1 with elements of #5.
Explore this direction - quiet and intimate
but with memory fragments woven in."
```

**Iterate:**
```
"This is close but feels too sentimental.
Push it toward restraint - less telling, more showing.
Remove any AI artifacts."
```

**Voice pass:**
```
"Now I'll take what we have and do my voice pass.
This is my final touch before we move on."
```

## Workflow 6: TDD Development Session

**Start with test:**
```
"Use the arcanea-tdd skill. I need to implement a
user authentication service. Help me write the
first failing test for the 'login' function."
```

**Write minimal code:**
```
"The test is failing as expected. Now help me write
the minimum code to make this test pass - no more."
```

**Refactor:**
```
"Tests are green. Now let's refactor -
improve the code while keeping tests passing."
```

**Next test:**
```
"What edge case should we test next?
Invalid password? Missing user? Rate limiting?"
```

---

## Workflow 7: Debugging with System

**Systematic approach:**
```
"Use arcanea-systematic-debug. I have a bug where
users intermittently get logged out.
Guide me through the scientific debugging method."
```

**Observe and reproduce:**
```
"I've gathered these observations: [details]
Help me form hypotheses about what could cause this."
```

**Test hypotheses:**
```
"Let's test hypothesis #2: race condition in token refresh.
What's the most efficient way to verify this?"
```

**Root cause and fix:**
```
"We've confirmed the race condition.
What's the minimal fix that addresses root cause,
not just the symptom?"
```

---

## Workflow 8: Design System Application

**Component design:**
```
"Use arcanea-design-system to help me design
a notification toast component.
Apply the cosmic aesthetic and glass morphism."
```

**Academy theming:**
```
"Now show me how this component would look
in each of the three academy themes:
Atlantean, Draconic, and Creation."
```

**Accessibility check:**
```
"Review this component for accessibility.
Does it meet WCAG standards?
What about reduced motion preferences?"
```

---

## Workflow 9: Strategic Planning Session

**Convene the Council:**
```
"Convene the Visionary Council.
I need to decide whether to launch my product
as a web app or a mobile app first.
Context: Solo developer, limited runway,
creative tools space."
```

**Gather perspectives:**
```
"Give me each Visionary's perspective:
- Strategist: Resource analysis
- Innovator: Creative alternatives
- Futurist: Market trajectory
- Synthesizer: Integration and recommendation"
```

**Make decision:**
```
"Based on the Council's synthesis,
I'm choosing [option].
What are the immediate next steps?"
```

---

## Workflow 10: Learning a New Skill

**Engage Teacher Mentor:**
```
"I want to learn narrative structure.
Use the teacher-mentor skill.
Start by assessing my current understanding."
```

**Follow curriculum:**
```
"Based on the assessment, create a learning path
for me. What should I learn first, second, third?"
```

**Practice:**
```
"Design a practice exercise for three-act structure.
Give me a scenario and let me try before providing feedback."
```

**Check progress:**
```
"We've been working on structure for a while.
Do a progress check - what have I mastered?
What needs more work?"
```
