# Arcanea Anti-Trope & Naming Protocol

> *"We do not 'unleash' potential; we cultivate it. We do not weave 'tapestries' of fate; we forge chains of consequence. Speak clearly, or do not speak at all."*

## 1. The Banned Lexicon (AI Hallucinations)

These words are forbidden in Arcanea narrative voice unless used in a strictly literal, physical sense. They are the markers of "lazy AI" writing.

| The Forbidden Word | Why It's Banned | The Better Alternative |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Delve** | Overused, implies generic depth without detail. | Investigate, excavate, study, pierce, analyze. |
| **Tapestry** | The ultimate AI cliché for complexity. | Network, system, architecture, collision, knot. |
| **Unleash** | Hyperbolic, comic-book power fantasy. | Release, unbind, trigger, deploy, open. |
| **Elevate** | Corporate marketing speak disguised as magic. | Raise, sharpen, refine, heighten, transcend. |
| **Unlock** | Gamified language. | Access, reveal, decrypt, open, solve. |
| **Symphony** | Unless actual music is playing, it's lazy. | Coordination, alignment, resonance, chorus. |
| **Nestled** | Every AI village is "nestled". | Hidden, perched, buried, anchored, set. |
| **Testament** | "A testament to..." is passive filler. | Proof, scar, monument, result, evidence. |
| **Realms** | (Context specific) Don't use for "areas". | Domains, zones, territories, disciplines. |
| **Nexus** | Generic sci-fi center. | Hub, core, convergence, heart, intersection. |
| **Luminous** | (Context specific) We use this, but EARN it. | Radiant, burning, searing, pale, glowing. |
| **Whispers** | "Whispers of the past..." is a trope. | Echoes, records, dust, scars, remnants. |

## 2. Naming Conventions

### The "Star Wars" Rule
Names must not sound like random syllables (e.g., *Xyloph*, *Zorpt*). They must have etymological roots (Latin, Greek, Norse, Sanskrit) or clear phonetics.

**Bad:** *Kael'thas*, *Xylar*, *Morpheus* (Matrix stolen).
**Good:** *Lumina* (Light), *Nero* (Black/Water), *Vorun* (Vor/Truth).

### The "Noun-Verb" Rule
Avoid "The [Adjective] [Noun]" formula for everything.
**Bad:** *The Silent Watcher*, *The Dark Blade*, *The Eternal Flame*.
**Good:** *Azariel*, *The Hungry Void*, *Yggdrasil*.

### The Academy Identifiers
*   **Atlantean:** Fluid, soft vowels, double 'l', 's', 'th'. (e.g., *Lúmendell*, *Thalassa*).
*   **Draconic:** Hard consonants, 'k', 'r', 'z', 'd'. (e.g., *Krozar*, *Drakon*).
*   **Creation:** Musical, rhythmic, 'a', 'o', 'm', 'n'. (e.g., *Melodia*, *Harmonia*).

## 3. Structural Tropes to Avoid

### The "Chosen One" Trap
Arcanea is about **collaboration**, not a single savior.
*   **Avoid:** "Only you can save the realm."
*   **Embrace:** "Only together can we sustain the Arc."

### The "Ancient Evil Awakens" Trap
*   **Avoid:** A generic dark lord waking up because "it is time."
*   **Embrace:** Systems decaying due to neglect (Entropy). The Dark Lord (Malachar) is a *result* of broken compassion, not just "evil".

### The "Magic Feather" Trap
*   **Avoid:** Artifacts that do everything for you.
*   **Embrace:** Tools that amplify *effort*. Magic requires cost (Energy Laws).

## 4. The "Human Check"
Before finalizing any text, read it aloud. If you sound like a movie trailer voiceover ("In a world where..."), delete it. If you sound like a marketing brochure ("Elevate your experience..."), delete it.

**The Goal:** Write like a historian of a world that actually exists.
