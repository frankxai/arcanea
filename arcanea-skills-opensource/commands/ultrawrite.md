**THE MAGIC WORD FOR WRITING**

Maximum parallel agent execution for crafting complete chapters or story sections.

## Usage

```
ultrawrite [description]
ulwr [description]
```

Just include `ultrawrite` or `ulwr` anywhere in your prompt.

## Examples

```
ultrawrite Chapter 5 - The Dragon's Awakening
ulwr the climactic battle between Kira and the Shadow King
ultrawrite Chapters 1-3 of Book 2
ulwr the opening scene establishing the Northern Kingdoms
```

## What Happens

When you invoke `ultrawrite`, Arcanea fires ALL writing agents simultaneously:

### Immediate Parallel Execution
