# Daily Log — 2025-09-21 (Sprint Sparkwave)

- Implemented guardian-aware chat experience in `Arcanea App/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` with Ignis, Lumis, Mythos selection, session tracking, and telemetry hooks (`codex:flow`, `codex:luminor`).
- Enhanced `/api/chat` to route by Luminor profile, switch prompts, and persist transcripts via Supabase admin client (`codex:flow`, `codex:guardrail`).
- Added Supabase client scaffolding, PostHog-friendly telemetry util, and environment samples to unblock deployment secrets.
