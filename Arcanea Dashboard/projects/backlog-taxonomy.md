# Backlog Taxonomy & Codex Consumption

Purpose: ensure every squad references the Arcanea Codex (`docs/ARCANEA_CODEX.md`) and Glossary (`docs/ARCANEA_GLOSSARY.md`) inside sprint boards, issues, and rituals.

## Shared Labels / Tags
| Label | Meaning | Applies To |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `codex:flow` | Work tied to Arcanea Flow automation or rituals | App, Studio, Platform |
| `codex:luminor` | Involves Luminor agents, wallets, or DAO roles | App, Knowledge, On-Chain |
| `codex:current` | Touches Currents of Magic (Mage/Flash/Vision/Edge/Seer/LoRA) | Studio, App |
| `codex:arc` | ARC token, NFTs, revenue splitter, staking | On-Chain, Platform |
| `codex:academy` | Academy curriculum, rituals, or lessons | Knowledge, App |
| `codex:guardrail` | Compliance, security, rituals from Codex Section 10 | Platform, Studio |

Apply these as GitHub labels, Linear tags, or Notion properties so reporting filters can pull Codex-aware views.

## Squad Consumption Checklist
- **Before Planning:** review Codex sections relevant to sprint goal (e.g., Section 2 for App, Section 6 for Studio). Note excerpts in sprint doc.
- **During Standup:** reference tag + Codex section when giving updates (see daily template).
- **During Demo:** include slide snippet or link to codex/glossary entry touched.
- **After Completion:** if new terminology emerged, submit Glossary update PR within 24 hours.

## Reporting Filters
- Weekly status reports should group items by `codex:*` label to show balance across flows, agents, and tokens.
- Metrics dashboard highlight: track proportion of shipped stories per codex label to ensure magical language coverage.

Maintaining this taxonomy keeps all squads aligned with the living Codex and prevents narrative drift.
