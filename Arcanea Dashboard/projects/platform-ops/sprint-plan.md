# Platform & Ops // Sprint Backlog

**Squad**: Nexus Core | **Ops Lead**: Nexus | **Engineering Manager**: TBD | **DevOps**: Claude Code (assist)

## Mission
Provide the infrastructure, security, analytics, and operational rigor that enable all Arcanea squads to ship safely and fast.

## Sprint Rhythm
- Sprint length: 2 weeks | Joint planning with all squads to capture dependencies.
- Capacity: 2 platform engineers, 1 data/analytics, 1 ops program manager.

## Sprint 1 (Sept 23 - Oct 6)
**Goal**: Establish unified tooling + deployment pipeline.
- Stabilize monorepo (pnpm + Turbo) with CI workflows (GitHub Actions) covering lint/test/build for active apps.
- Set up secrets management (Doppler/Vault) and update documentation for env provisioning.
- Implement logging/monitoring baseline (Datadog or Sentry + Logflare) for App/Studio.
- Automate preview deployments (Vercel) per PR, ensure access controls.
- Publish engineering handbook snippet on branching, reviews, release process.
**Deliverables**: CI pipeline, secrets handbook, monitoring dashboards.
**Dependencies**: App/Studio for service manifests, Security consultant for secrets tool selection.
**Metrics**: CI success rate >90%, deployment lead time <1 day.

## Sprint 2 (Oct 7 - Oct 20)
**Goal**: Instrument data and reliability guardrails.
- Build metrics ingestion (PostHog + Supabase) aggregated into shared dashboard.
- Define SLOs (availability, latency) and implement alerting policies.
- Integrate Langfuse + eval data into analytics for cross-team reporting.
- Document incident response playbook and run tabletop exercise.
- Kick off cost tracking (Vercel, Supabase, Thirdweb) with weekly review.
**Deliverables**: KPI dashboard, SLO policy doc, incident handbook.
**Dependencies**: Studio for Langfuse data, On-Chain for blockchain monitoring feeds.
**Metrics**: Alert coverage across 100% critical services, tabletop complete.

## Sprint 3 (Oct 21 - Nov 3)
**Goal**: Harden security & compliance posture.
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) across repos, Supabase, Thirdweb.
- Add static/dynamic security scanning (Snyk, Dependabot, npm audit) into CI.
- Prepare compliance checklist (SOC2-lite) and map to PI milestones.
- Launch centralized documentation portal (mirror of dashboard + Notion export).
- Conduct risk review with DAO security committee.
**Deliverables**: RBAC matrix, security scanning reports, compliance roadmap.
**Dependencies**: On-Chain for contract scanning, Knowledge team for doc portal content.
**Metrics**: Critical vulnerabilities resolved <72h, compliance tasks backlog prioritized.

## Backlog Highlights
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) for OCI expansion.
- Automated load testing harness.
- FinOps automation script.

## Risks & Mitigations
1. **Tool sprawl** – enforce procurement checklist before adopting new tools.
2. **CI flakiness** – monitor failure patterns, maintain test data seams.
3. **Documentation drift** – schedule weekly doc review, assign owners per section.

## Coordination
- Host weekly Ops clinic (Wed) for inter-squad blockers.
- Maintain `status/platform-weekly.md` with pipeline health + risk log.
- Partner with App/Studio to adopt shared component library + coding standards.
