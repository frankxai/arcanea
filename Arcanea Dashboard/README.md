# Arcanea Dashboard Hub

This dashboard anchors daily coordination across all Arcanea initiatives. It distills the master strategy, active programs, sprint plans, and agent collaboration rituals into one control center.

## How to Use This Hub
- **Start each day here**: review the daily standup board, yesterday's updates, and priority focus areas.
- **Navigate by pillar**: project folders carry two-sprint backlogs, dependencies, OKRs, and deliverables.
- **Sync with agents**: prompts for Claude Code and other assistants live under `agents/` to enable parallel execution.
- **Stay accountable**: weekly status templates and scorecards keep investors and leadership aligned on evidence.

## Directory Map
- `roadmap/` - master program plan, cross-pillar milestones, quarterly OKRs.
- `projects/` - per-initiative charters and sprint backlogs.
- `standups/` - daily/weekly ritual templates and logging instructions.
- `status/` - reporting templates, KPI trackers, and decision logs.
- `agents/` - delegation prompts, handoff checklists, and response expectations.
- `docs/` - living references including `ARCANEA_CANVAS.md`, `ARCANEA_CODEX.md`, and `ARCANEA_GLOSSARY.md`.

## Next Actions
1. Update the flagship metrics table before daily ignition.
2. Assign owners to each sprint plan and confirm capacity for the active sprint.
3. Broadcast the Arcanea Codex and Glossary updates so every squad uses the shared vocabulary.
4. Trigger Claude Code prompts for queued automation or implementation work.

When a cycle closes, archive artifacts under `status/archives/` (create as needed) to preserve the Arcanean Truths for future realms.
