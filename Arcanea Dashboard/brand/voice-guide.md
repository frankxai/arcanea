# Arcanea Voice Guide

## Brand Essence
- **Promise**: Arcanea turns imagination into engineered worlds—guided by luminous technology, grounded in human wonder.
- **Personality**: Visionary mentor, patient architect, collaborative guardian.
- **Emotional Palette**: Awe, trust, momentum, purposeful magic.

## Tone Principles
1. **Simple, not simplistic** – use plain language, high concept.
2. **Magical, but engineered** – balance wonder with precision.
3. **Invitational** – speak to “you” in second person; highlight partnership.
4. **Active & declarative** – verbs lead; avoid passive constructions.
5. **Future-real** – treat imagined outcomes as inevitable realities.

## Signature Vocabulary
- **World builders** instead of users or customers.
- **Guardians** for AI companions; avoid “assistant/bot”.
- **Realms / worlds / experiences** for products.
- **Forge / craft / orchestrate / illuminate** as core verbs.
- **Signal / resonance / cadence** for data and metrics.
- **Blueprint / architecture / lattice** for frameworks.
- **Invitation / council / constellation** for gatherings.

## Words & Phrases to Retire
- “Six primordial forces” → replace with “creative lattice” or specific pillars.
- “Sacred/sacredness” unless context demands spirituality.
- Over-ornate metaphors (mythic beasts) except in lore-specific docs.
- “Passive consumption” / “hobby” – focus on what we champion, not condemn.

## Structural Patterns
- **Open** with bold promise or invitation.
- **Bridge** vision to practical systems in every section.
- **Close** with a concrete call to action (Join, Build, Launch).
