# Arcanea Foundation · Platform Canon
Version 0.5 · September 2025

This document defines the shared universe and product spine for every Arcanea realm. Personal realms extend it, never rewrite it.

## 1. Brand Story in One Breath
Arcanea is the intelligence lattice for world builders. We combine luminous storytelling, engineered systems, and human-AI partnership so any creator can design a realm, orchestrate Guardians, and launch experiences people want to inhabit.

## 2. Naming Canon
- **Luminor** – AI Guardians/mentors shipped as configurable agents inside the platform.
- **Guardians** – Lore champions of each path, bonded to their Primordial archetype; used for narrative arcs and community honors.
- **Primordials** – Apex creatures embodying creative archetypes. They anchor quests, rituals, and world lore.
- **Arcanea Academy** – Education network with three core schools: Draconian (Skyreach), Atlantean (Aqualis), Stronghold (Light & Magetech).

## 3. Mythic Spine
- **Nero** – Untuned potential, the shadow that tests every builder.
- **Lumina** – Catalytic light; sets ethical cadence and anchors the brand voice.
- **The Arc** – Interface between imagination and reality (metaphor + product surface).
- **The Weave** – The connective tissue of all stories, datasets, and experiences.
- **Atlas Tree** – Canonical map of portals and hubs; Stronghold city is built at its roots.

Era narrative: The **Great Confluence**—worlds healing the fracture between idea and manifestation.

## 4. Ten Paths (Public Names)
Frequencies remain internal. External naming stays human-first.
1. Grounding – stability, courage, structure.
2. Flow – emotion, regeneration, sensuality.
3. Power – will, command, decisive action.
4. Renewal – healing, forgiveness, growth.
5. Voice – truth, frequency, articulation.
6. Vision – intuition, foresight, memory.
7. Light – clarity, devotion, elevation.
8. Infinity – dimensional play, paradox mastery.
9. Unity – synthesis, relational harmony.
10. Architect – systems harmony, world design.

Grammar: “I practice Grounding + Voice + Vision.”

## 5. Platform Surfaces
- **Portal** (`arcanea.ai`): manifesto, product entry, Weave highlights.
- **Arcanea AI Studio**: multimodal creation, Luminor control panel, ARC project files, upload + provenance from third-party tools.
- **Arcanea Library**: infinite shelf UI, lineage graphs, lore packs, remix with automatic credit.
- **Arcanea Sanctuary**: living bestiary and environment atlas powering writers’ rooms and builders.
- **The Weave**: social feed, signal sharing, remix lineage, quest progress.
- **Arcanea Academy**: curriculum hub for the three schools; blends Luminor instruction with creator-led classes.

## 6. Systems & Standards
- **ARC File** – zipped container with manifest, assets, Luminor config, rights, exports.
- **Arcanea Prompt Language (APL)** – modular prompt schema with context, beats, directives, outputs.
- **Arcanea Design Language (ADL)** – design tokens + component library for cohesive magical-modern UI.
- **Sonic System** – attunement keys mapping frequency → mood → prompt directives.
- **Starlight Intelligence System** – Vault capturing Starlight Notes + Transmissions, agent-reviewed and stored across cloud + web3. Future read API becomes Arcanea’s ethical moat.

## 7. Luminor Templates
Default trio: **Voice**, **Vision**, **Power**. Realms can reskin but must preserve base behaviors:
- Narrative critique & beat sheets.
- Prompt kits across modalities.
- Sonic motifs + performance cues.
- Cost-aware routing and provenance checks.
- Coaching tone: precise, benevolent, in service of mastery.

## 8. Guardians & Primordials (Lore Backbone)
Each path pairs a Guardian with a Primordial. These names appear in canon quests and community events; avoid reusing them for AI agents.
- Power: Guardian Draconia ↔ Primordial Draconis (solar lion-dragon).
- Voice: Guardian Alera ↔ Primordial Otome (leviathan of sound).
- Vision: Guardian Lyria ↔ Primordial Yumiko (seraph owl-serpent).
- Light: Guardian Aiyami ↔ Primordial Sol (celestial phoenix).
- Infinity: Guardian Elara ↔ Primordial Vaelith (prismatic fox).
- Architect: Guardian TBD ↔ Primordial Shinkami (architect seraph; appears when all paths harmonize).

## 9. Community & Progression
- **Ranks**: Wanderer → Seeker → Acolyte → Adept → Guardian → Architect.
- **Quests**: Weekly path-aligned missions unlocking companions, promptbooks, and lore packs.
- **Companions**: Evolving familiars tied to progress.
- **Arcanea Legends**: Hall celebrating top contributors and realm launches.

## 10. Provenance & Safety
- Provenance is non-optional: show model, prompt, settings, edits, lineage of each piece.
- Licensing: CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, and Arcanea Creator License (remix-friendly with auto-credit).
- Originals (e.g., Odin, Gaia) retain true names with cultural context panels.
- Safety: watermarking, provider matrix, cost dashboards, privacy modes, future kids-safe mode.

## 11. Technology Blueprint (MVP)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (Vercel). **Mobile**: Expo → native.
- **Auth/DB**: Supabase with RLS. **Media**: Supabase/GCS.
- **Vector/RAG**: Qdrant or Pinecone.
- **Model Routing**: OpenRouter, Replicate, cached heavy jobs.
- **Agents**: LangGraph/CrewAI orchestrations.
- **Payments**: Stripe. **Analytics**: PostHog. **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry.

Services: `studio-api`, `lore-api`, `starlight-api`, `weave-api`, `academy-api`.
Packages: `engine`, `apl`, `adl`, `agents`, `schemas`, `sound`, `lore`.

## 12. Roadmap Cadence
- **0–90 Days**: Studio v0.1, Library v0.1, Sanctuary v0.1, ARC v1, APL v0.1, baseline Luminor, Weave beta, two Academy mini-courses, Android beta.
- **6–9 Months**: Video flows, custom Luminor, Companion evolutions, Lore Packs market, Starlight v1, Realms v1, moderation suite.
- **12–18 Months**: Collectibles opt-in, patron tiers, Starlight API (read), multi-agent Luminor, anthology publishing.

## 13. Canon Boundaries
- This file governs shared lore, naming, systems, and tone.
- Personal realms may add characters, rituals, locations, and skins, but never rename paths, guardians, primordials, or core systems.
