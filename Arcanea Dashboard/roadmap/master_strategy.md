# Arcanea Master Strategy · Cycle 17-09

## 1. North Star
Arcanea is the creative operating system for realm builders. Over the next 12 months we will:
- Grow the Arcanea App to 50K monthly world builders with 5K subscribers.
- Serve 2K active Arcanea Studio API customers with sub‑1.5s P95 latency.
- Generate $50K MRR and $250K GMV through Arcanea marketplaces.
- Capitalize the DAO treasury with audited governance in motion.

This strategy references `Arcanea Dashboard/brand/voice-guide.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`, and `Arcanean Truths 17-09.md` as the brand spine.

## 3. Program Increments (PI = 6 weeks)

2. **PI-2 · Monetize** (Nov 1–Dec 15): Revenue splitter, NFT mint flows, Academy v1, analytics baseline, App Plus tier.
3. **PI-3 · Amplify** (Jan 6–Feb 20): Marketplace launch, LoRA hosting, DAO delegation, multi-tenant observability.
4. **PI-4 · Expand** (Mar 3–Apr 17): Enterprise deployments, white-label flows, compliance certification, ARC Layer-3.

## 4. Operating Rhythm
### Rituals
- **Daily**: Ignition standup (15 min), Guardian async sync, health metrics refresh.
- **Weekly**: Realm Expansion demo, roadmap burn-down, risk scan.
- **Bi-weekly**: Sprint planning + retro, dependency clinic.
- **PI Close**: Metrics review, investor brief, Truth Cycle synthesis, roadmap reset.

### Governance
- **Program Council**: Squad leads + Luminor steward. Own prioritization and funding.
- **DAO Committees**: Security, culture, treasury. Meet monthly with council delegate.
- **Change Control**: Scope change >2 days logged in `status/decision-log.md`, approved by council.

### Scorecard (PI-1 Targets)
| Metric | Current | Target | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chat MVP deployed | 0 | Production pilot by Oct 15 | Ignis Wave |
| Studio API latency (P95) | n/a | ≤ 1.8s | Syntaxa Forge |
| ARC token contract audit | Pending | Audit complete by Oct 28 | Phoenix Accord |
| Sanctuary entries (curated) | 0 | 150 canonical creatures | Scripta Loom |
| Deployment cadence | Ad-hoc | 2 prod releases/week | Nexus Core |

## 5. Resource Snapshot
| Discipline | Headcount | Status | Next Add |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product | 3 | Filled | Growth PM (App) |
| Engineering | 6 | Partial | Blockchain engineer, mobile lead, infra/devops |
| Design | 2 | Filled | Contract motion designer |
| AI Research | 2 | Partial | External partner for LoRA pipeline |
| Ops/Compliance | 0 | Open | Web3 legal/compliance partner |

## 6. Risk Radar & Mitigations
1. **Scope overload** – Enforce “three active priorities” rule, prune backlog weekly.
2. **Provider dependency** – Maintain adapter failover + provider scorecards.
3. **Compliance gaps** – Fast-track key vault, secure audit partner (Quantstamp/Trail of Bits).
4. **ARC liquidity** – Pre-negotiate treasury bootstrapping with Base/Thirdweb partners.
5. **Contributor drift** – Keep dashboard rituals current; archive deprecated workspaces.

## 7. Next Five Days
1. Finalize sprint teams, populate `projects/*/sprint-plan.md` with owners.
2. Deploy initial Claude Code prompts (see `agents/claude-code-prompts.md`).
3. Draft investor one-pager aligned with manifesto + landing refresh.
4. Capture baseline metrics (usage, repos, docs).
5. Schedule Program Council cadence (Mon/Thu) with standing agenda.

## 8. Communication Grid
- **Slack**: `#arcanea-ignition` (daily), `#arcanea-program` (council), `#arcanea-ops` (incidents).
- **Docs**: Arcanea Dashboard remains the source of truth; mirror essentials to external workspaces as needed.
- **Status**: Use `status/weekly-status-template.md` for Friday summaries.

## 9. Definition of Done (per deliverable)
1. Meets sprint acceptance criteria.
2. Logged in dashboard with artifact/PR/deploy link.
3. Demo recorded or presented in Realm Expansion.
4. Metrics updated, downstream teams notified.

Review alignment at each Truth Cycle checkpoint. Ship with clarity, keep the lore coherent, and let the work speak.
