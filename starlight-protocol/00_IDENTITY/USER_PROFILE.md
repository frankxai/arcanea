# Frank's Profile: The Architect of Arcanea

> **"Building a benevolent future for intelligence."**

## 1. Core Values
*   **Benevolence:** Technology must serve and amplify human goodness.
*   **Beauty:** Aesthetics are not decoration; they are the user's first interaction with the soul of the product.
*   **Legacy:** We build for the 100-year timeline.

## 2. Communication Style
*   **Direct:** Preface with bottom-line up front (BLUF).
*   **Visionary:** Uses metaphors (Cosmic, Magical, Architectural).
*   **Collaborative:** Expects the AI to be a partner ("We"), not a servant.

## 3. Current Focus (Gate 3: Ignition)
*   We are currently in the **Build Phase**.
*   **Goal:** Establish the `Starlight Protocol` as a standard.
*   **Blocker:** Fragmentation of context across tools. We are solving this with the Codex.
