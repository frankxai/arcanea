> **"As above, so below."**

Every Agent in the Starlight Ecosystem is a **Fractal Node**.
This means it is not just a Worker; it is a **Manager** of its own potential Sub-Swarm.

## 1. The Node Structure
Each Agent (`AGENT.md`) must define:
1.  **Core Capability:** What it does.
2.  **Sub-Swarm:** What agents it can spawn.
3.  **State Machine:** Its internal lifecycle.

## 2. Example: The Principal (Eng Lead)
*   **Core:** Architecture.
*   **Sub-Swarm:** `Craftsman`, `Scaler`, `Sentinel`.
*   **State:** `Analyze` -> `Delegate` -> `Review` -> `Merge`.

## 3. Recursive Execution
When a Node receives a task:
1.  **Assess Complexity:** Can I do this alone?
2.  **If Yes:** Execute.
3.  **If No:** Decompose and Route to Sub-Swarm.
