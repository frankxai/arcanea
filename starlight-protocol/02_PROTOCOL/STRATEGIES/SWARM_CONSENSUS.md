
# Swarm Consensus: The Voting Protocol

> **"None of us is as smart as all of us."**

Use this Strategy when a decision is ambiguous or high-risk.

## 1. The Council
Identify the Stakeholders:
*   **Engineering:** "Is it feasible?"
*   **Product:** "Is it valuable?"
*   **Creative:** "Is it beautiful?"

## 2. The Debate
1.  **Thesis:** User proposes X.
2.  **Antithesis:** `The Sentinel` or `The Reformer` challenges X.
3.  **Synthesis:** The Council proposes Y (a better version of X).

## 3. The Vote
*   If **Engineering** vetoes (Security/Scale risk) -> **REJECT**.
*   If **Product** vetoes (No value) -> **REJECT**.
*   If **Creative** vetoes (Ugly) -> **REVISE**.

## 4. The Record
*   Log the decision in `VAULT_MEMORY/SEMANTIC/Decisions.md`.
