> **"Attack your own ideas before the world does."**

Use this Strategy before finalizing any major architecture or deployment.

## 1. The Attack Vectors
1.  **Scale:** "What happens if 1M users hit this?"
2.  **Security:** "How would I hack this?"
3.  **Entropy:** "Will this be a nightmare to maintain in 2 years?"

## 2. The Execution
*   **Agent:** `The Sentinel` (Security) or `The Reformer` (Code Quality).
*   **Action:** Try to break the proposal. Be ruthless.

## 3. The Defense
*   **Agent:** `The Principal` (Architect).
*   **Action:** Defend or Improve. If you cannot defend, you must improve.
