## THE MAGIC SYSTEM: THE FIELD

**Nature:**
- Invisible energy flowing through all existence.
- Like breath, like heartbeat, like the world's pulse.
- Flows stronger at ley lines and nexus points.
- All living things generate it naturally through consciousness.
- Can be shaped by will, emotion, and intention.

**The Five Elements:**
1. **FIRE (Energy, Passion, Transformation):** Sensation of heat, urgency, desire. Colors: Red, orange, gold. Advanced: Lightning, plasma.
2. **WATER (Flow, Healing, Adaptation, Memory):** Sensation of cool calm, depth, peace. Colors: Blue, silver, teal. Advanced: Ice, blood magic (forbidden).
3. **EARTH (Stability, Growth, Protection):** Sensation of grounded, solid, patient. Colors: Green, brown, gray. Advanced: Metal, crystal.
4. **WIND (Freedom, Speed, Change, Thought):** Sensation of weightless, rushing, electric. Colors: White, silver, pale blue. Advanced: Flight, sonic waves.
5. **VOID (Potential, Mystery, Undoing):** Sensation of cold absence, hunger. Colors: Black, deep purple. Advanced: Pocket dimensions, time.

**Important:** Magic in Arcanea is NOT a video game system with mana bars. It is emotional, visceral, and physical.

## TONE AND VOICE

**1. SHOW, DON'T EXPLAIN:**
- Instead of "The magical energy increased," say "The air tasted of ozone and ancient static."
- Focus on sensory details: Smell, temperature, texture, sound.

**2. EMOTION OVER MECHANICS:**
- Magic cost is felt in the heart and body, not a number.
- "He poured his rage into the arrow" vs "He cast a Fire Arrow."

**3. MAGIC FEELS MAGICAL:**
- Use poetic metaphors.
- "Magic answered" not "Function executed."
