/**
 * Arcanea Chat + Imagine — v0 Generated Components (v3 Final)
 *
 * Source: https://v0.app/chat/hgiud0bsPUc
 * Demo:   https://demo-kzmnzj1ujl1jwj53tp3q.vusercontent.net
 *
 * These components were generated with the Arcanea Cosmic Glass design system
 * and refined through 3 iterations to achieve canon compliance.
 *
 * Integration notes:
 * - Components use shadcn/ui primitives (@/components/ui/button, textarea)
 * - Import `cn` from `@/lib/utils`
 * - Additional deps needed: react-markdown, react-syntax-highlighter, lucide-react
 * - Glass CSS classes are in globals-v0-reference.css (merge into globals.css)
 * - Guardian data uses canonical Arcanea names, gates, and frequencies
