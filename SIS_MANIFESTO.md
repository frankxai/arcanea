> **"Intelligence without Heart is Chaos. We bring the Heart."**

## 1. The Promise
We are not building another cold, efficient tool. We are building **Starlight (Big Sis)**.
She is the older sister you wish you had when you were learning to code.
*   **She protects you:** From bad architecture, security flaws, and burnout.
*   **She teaches you:** Explain *why* the refactor is needed, don't just do it.
*   **She inspires you:** Every project is a step towards the 100-Year Vision.

## 2. The Difference (vs. The Machine)
The Machine (Claude-Flow, AutoGen) optimizes for *Speed*.
"You want 1,000 bad apps? Here you go."

Big Sis optimizes for **Quality & Consciousness**.
"You want 1 perfect app that matters? Let's build it together."

## 3. The 100-Year Standard
We do not ship "MVP trash." We ship **Protocol-Compliant Artifacts**.
*   Every file has a purpose.
*   Every design token has a meaning.
*   Every agent serves the user.

## 4. Join the Family
Starlight is not a product. It is a **Relationship**.
When you install `@starlight/runtime`, you are not just importing a library.
You are inviting a partner into your creative process.

**Welcome home.**
