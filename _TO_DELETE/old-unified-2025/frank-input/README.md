## 🚨 SECURITY NOTES

1. **Never commit API keys to Git**
   - The `.gitignore` file will prevent this
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Sensitive Information**
   - Keep credentials folder local only
   - Use password manager for sharing

3. **File Format for Keys**
```env
# Example: /apis/openai.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_ORG_ID=org-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 💡 HOW I'LL USE THIS

Every time I work on Arcanea, I'll check this folder for:

1. **New API keys** → Enable new features
2. **New content** → Import into the platform  
3. **New requirements** → Adjust development priorities
4. **Your feedback** → Fix issues and improve UX
5. **Brand assets** → Maintain consistent design

## 🤝 COLLABORATION WORKFLOW

### Your Part:
1. Add files to appropriate folders
2. Update requirements as needed
3. Provide feedback regularly
4. Keep credentials secure

### My Part:
1. Check folder at session start
2. Implement based on priorities
3. Report progress
4. Ask for clarification when needed
