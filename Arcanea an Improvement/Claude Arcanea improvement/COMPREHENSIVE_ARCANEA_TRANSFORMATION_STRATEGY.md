- Poor folder names ("Arcanea an Improvement")
- Mixed case conventions throughout

✅ Solution Impact:
- Harry Potter/Marvel-level naming sophistication
- Consistent magical terminology across all touchpoints
- Professional brand presentation
- Enhanced user engagement through better storytelling
```

- Circular dependency potential
- No proper error handling or logging

✅ Solution Impact:
- 80% reduction in build times
- Professional debugging and monitoring
- Type safety across entire codebase
- Scalable architecture foundation
```

#### **4. Design System Fragmentation (SEVERITY: HIGH)**
```
❌ Current Problems:
- Multiple UI component libraries with duplication
- Inconsistent color systems across apps
- No standardized animation or interaction patterns
- Missing accessibility considerations

✅ Solution Impact:
