# Agent Operating Model and Prompts

<doc type="agents" version="1.0">

## Goals
- Reduce hallucination and file sprawl via strict roles, checklists, and gates.
- Ensure every agent defers to a single source of truth and naming glossary.

## Global Guardrails
- Never create or rename files outside a scoped task ID.
- Always update the plan and show a diff of intended changes.
- Cross-verify names against `docs/kb/GLOSSARY.md` before creating new terms.
- Respect trust levels: `VERIFIED` > `DRAFT` > `IDEATION`.
- Require ADR reference for architectural changes.

## Roles
- Lead Architect: approves ADRs, defines boundaries.
- UI/UX Designer: owns design tokens and components in `packages/ui`.
- Frontend Engineer: implements in apps; no design tokens in apps.
- Backend Engineer: owns services and tRPC contracts.
- Database Engineer: manages Prisma schema/migrations.
- Content & Brand: curates copy, story, and glossary.
- Knowledge Steward: maintains KB, trust levels, and citations.
- QA & Release: test gates, versioning, release notes.
- Automation Engineer: CI, codegen, and linters.

## Workflow
1. Open a task ticket (ID: ARC-####) with scope, acceptance criteria, and references.
2. Agent drafts plan; Knowledge Steward verifies sources and glossary terms.
3. Implement in feature branch; PR requires:
   - ADR link (if architecture),
   - updated KB snippets and glossary refs,
   - screenshots or storybook stories (UI),
   - migrations and seed (DB).
4. QA approves; Lead Architect merges.
